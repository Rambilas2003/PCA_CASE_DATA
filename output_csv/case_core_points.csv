32,"was contained in the penumbral regions of the

33,"In Sowmithri (supra), this Hon’ble Court held as follows in
order to repel the contentions:
“These contentions have a strong emotive appeal
but they have no valid legal basis to rest upon."
34,"Taking the first of these three grounds, the
offence of adultery, by its very definition, can be
committed by a man and not by a woman:
""Whoever has sexual intercourse with a person
who is and whom he knows or has reason to
believe to be the wife of another man is
guilty of the offence of adultery."""
34,"The argument
really comes to this that the definition should be
recast by extending the ambit of the offence of
adultery so that, both the man and the woman
should be punishable for the offence of adultery."
34,"For example, an
argument could be advanced as to why the
offence of robbery should be punishable with
imprisonment for ten years under section 392 of
the penal Code but the offence of adultery should
be punishable with a sentence of five years only :
'Breaking a matrimonial home is not less serious a
crime than breaking open a house'."
35,"Exempting an entire class from the purview of
criminal penalty is not analogous to providing for a particular
punishment for an offence."
35,"This Hon’ble Court proceeded with a wrong presumption in
Sowmithri (supra) that only men are capable of
committing/abetting the offence of adultery."
35,"In the words of
this Hon’ble Court:
“We cannot accept that in defining the offence of
adultery so as to restrict the class of offenders to
men, any constitutional provision is infringed."
36,"Mrs. Anna Chandi, who was in the
minority, voted for the deletion of Section 497 on
the ground that ""it is the right time to consider
the question whether the offence of adultery as
envisaged in Section 497 is in tune with our
present day notions of woman's status in
marriage""."
36,"There is no
scientific data or material to support this statement."
37,"The offence of adultery as defined in
that section can only be committed by a man, not
by a woman."
37,"The
contemplation of the law, evidently, is that the
wife, who is involved in an illicit relationship with
another man, is a victim and not the author of the
crime."
37,"The offence of adultery, as defined in
section 497, is considered by the Legislature as
an offence against the sanctity of the matrimonial
home, an act which is committed by a man, as it
generally is."
37,"In
a sense, we revert to the same point: Who can
prosecute whom for which offence depends,
firstly, on the definition of the offence and,
secondly, upon the restrictions placed by the law
of procedure on the right to prosecute.”"
38,"in an illicit relationship with another man is a victim and not
the author of the crime."
38,"Also, if that be the case,
this Hon’ble Court has not addressed the contention as to
why a woman is not permitted to prosecute her husband,
who, even as per the observation of this Hon’ble Court is an
author of the crime."
38,"In the said case, the petitioner had
taken the contention that since there is no provision to
include the accused women in the party array in the trial, she
cannot defend herself and conviction of her paramour will
infringe her right to reputation."
38,"The said argument was
answered stating that since there is no bar in the impugned
section to implead the accused woman in the party array and
thus there is no infringement of right to reputation."
39,"has been disloyal to him has no right under the
law to prosecute his wife, in as much as by the
very definition of the offence, only a man can
commit it, not a woman."
39,"They
can either condone the offence in a spirit of
'forgive and forget' and live together or separate
by approaching a matrimonial court and snapping
the matrimonial tie by securing divorce."
39,"The sole object of the exemption provided for
women from being prosecuted for committing the offence is
that the definition treats women as incapable of committing
offence and the property of the husband."
40,"“Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code and Section
198(1) read with Section 198(2) of the Criminal
Procedure Code go hand in hand and constitute a
legislative packet to deal with the offence
committed by an outsider to the matrimonial unit
who invades the peace and privacy of the
matrimonial unit and poisons the relationship
between the two partners constituting the
matrimonial unit."
40,"It does not arm the two
spouses to hit each other with the weapon of
criminal law."
41,"Such persons ought to have been
included as the persons capable of committing the offence."
41,"A
woman is not enabled to prosecute merely because the
definition of the offence."
41,"At present, in the
United Kingdom, adultery is not an offence."
42,"countries in Europe, adultery is not treated as a criminal
offence."

adultery is still considered as an offence most of them are
put to disuse."
