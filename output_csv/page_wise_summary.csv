This Writ Petition is filed challenging the constitutional
validity of Section 497 of IPC and Section 198 (2) of CrPC. This is a Public Interest Litigation and the Petitioner has no
personal interest in the matter. Section 497 of the IPC is prima facie unconstitutional on the
ground that it discriminates against men and violates Article
14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. When the sexual
intercourse takes place with the consent of both the parties,
there is no good reason for excluding one party from the
liability."
5,"and Ors v. Union of India and Ors., 2015(1) SCC 192. (Also
see Frontiero v Richardson, (1973) 411 US 677). The said
provision also does not pass the test of reasonable
classification as enunciated in State of W.B. v. Anwar Ali
Sarkar, AIR 1952 SC 75. The said provision is also hit by the ratio laid down in Justice
K.S Puttaswamy (Retd. )"
6,"committing ‘Adultery’. S.497 reads:
“497. Adultery.—Whoever has sexual
intercourse with a person who is and
whom he knows or has reason to believe
to be the wife of another man, without
the consent or connivance of that man,
such sexual intercourse not amounting to
the offence of rape, is guilty of the
offence of adultery, and shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to five
years, or with fine, or with both. In such
case the wife shall not be punishable as
an abettor.”"
7,"with the leave of the Court, make a
complaint on his behalf.” Both of these provisions are violative of
fundamental rights guaranteed under
Articles 14, 15 and 21 of Constitution of
India. 10.03.1954 For the first time, Section 497 was
challenged stating that the exemption
provided for women being prosecuted is
discriminatory and the same was repelled
by this Hon’ble Court in Yusuf Abdul Aziz
v. State of Bombay and Another, AIR
1954 SC 321, stating that the same falls
within the ambit of Article 15(3). 1971 The 42nd Law Commission Report
analysed various provisions of Indian
Penal Code and made significant
recommendations."
8,"25.02.1988 The constitutional validity of Section 497
of the IPC along with the Section 198 (2)
of CrPC was challenged in V. Revathi v.
Union of India, (1988) 2 (SCC) 72. This
Hon’ble Supreme Court repelled the
challenge relying on the decision of the
Supreme Court in Sowmithri (supra). March, 2003 The Report of Committee on Reforms of
Criminal Justice System, Vol 1, March
2003 was published."
9,"18.10.2012 A Working Group of United Nations
established by the Geneva-based Human
Rights Council in September 2010 urged
the countries to eliminate laws that
classify adultery as a criminal offence. 20.06.2015 The Supreme Court of South Korea has
struck down Article 241 of the Criminal
Act (enacted as Law No. 293 of
September 19, 1953) which stipulates
imprisonment for two years or less for
adultery and interdiction. The judgment
held that the impugned clause therein
violated the principle of excessive
prohibition and infringed on peoples’ right
to self-determination and privacy and
freedom of privacy."

THE HON’BLE CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA

THE HON’BLE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA"
11,"THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE
PETITIONER ABOVE NAMED
MOST RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH:
1. The Petitioner herein is filing the present Writ Petition under
Article 32 of the Constitution of India for issuance of a Writ,
order or direction in the nature of Mandamus or any other
appropriate Writ or order challenging the constitutional
validity of Section 497 of Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereinafter IPC) which defines ‘Adultery’ and prescribes the
punishment. The Petitioner herein also challenges Section
198(2) CrPC. These Sections are apparently discriminatory
and they violate the principles of gender justice."
12,"criminal nor revenue litigation, involving the Petitioner herein
which has or could have a legal nexus with the issues
involved in the present Public Interest Litigation. 3. The Petitioner herein has the locus to file the present PIL as
he is a public spirited person and is keen and active in
fighting for the cause of public in general since years. The
adverse impact of Section 497 IPC and Section 198(2) CrPC
upon gender justice is a great concern to be addressed as it
violates the rights of a citizen guaranteed under Article 14,
15 and 21 of the Constitution."
13,"and on all these occasions, the challenge was repelled by this
Hon’ble Court. With due respect, it is submitted that the said
decisions have not appreciated the contentions in the right
sense. However, in view of the emerging jurisprudence on
Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution and the changed
social conditions, this writ petition is filed seeking
reconsideration and a direction to declare s. 497 IPC and s.
198(2) CrPC as unconstitutional. 7."
14,"is a also an outdated provision, in addition to being illegal
and violative of fundamental rights. ii) This writ petition is filed challenging the constitutional validity
of S.497 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter IPC) which
defines ‘Adultery’ and prescribes the punishment. The
petitioner also challenges s. 198(2) CrPC."
15,"offence was com- mitted may, with the leave of
the Court, make a complaint on his behalf.” iv) The above provisions are discriminatory and violative of
Article 14 of Constitution of India. Section 497 IPC was
challenged before this Hon’ble Court on three occasions,
firstly in Yusuf Abdul Aziz v. State of Bombay and Another,
AIR 1954 SC 321, secondly in Sowmithri Vishnu v. Union of
India, AIR 1985 SC 1618 and finally, in V. Revathi v. Union of
India, (1988) 2 (SCC) 72. In Revathi (supra), the
constitutionality of Section 198(2)"
16,"revamping the Criminal Justice System. In the report
submitted by the Committee, in the Chapter “Offense against
Women” under the subhead “Adultery: Section 497 IPC” it is
stated:
“16.3.1 A man commits the offence of adultery if
he has sexual intercourse with the wife of another
man without the consent or connivance of the
husband. The object of this Section is to preserve
the sanctity of the marriage. The society abhors
marital infidelity."
17,"Police and Another, (2012) 1 SCC 348. Therein, this Hon'ble
Court was pleased to observe that:
""The provision is currently under criticism from
certain quarters for showing a strong gender bias
for it makes the position of a married woman
almost as a property of her husband"". The true copy of the judgment dated 01.12.2011 in Crl. Appeal No.2232/2011 is produced herewith and marked as
ANNEXURE P-3 (Pages 53 to 55).
ix)"
18,"against Section 497 have to be assessed afresh in the light of
changed social and legal scenario. xii) Hence the present Writ Petition before this Hon’ble Court. That in the circumstances mentioned hereinabove, this Writ
Petition is being preferred by the Petitioner inter alia on the
following among other grounds:
GROUNDS
A)"
19,"and 15 of the Constitution. The true scope and nature of
Article 14 of the Constitution was highlighted in Maneka
Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 2 SCR 621 and R.D. Shetty
v. Airport Authority, (1979) 3 SCR 1014. In E.P Royappa V
State Of Tamil Nadu, 1974(4) SCC 3, it was held as follows:
“The basic principle which therefore informs both
Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition
against discrimination. Now, what is the content
and reach of this great equalizing principle?"
20,"14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action
and ensure fairness and equality of treatment. ""
Further, in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib, AIR 1981 SC 487 it
was held as follows:
“If the Society is an ""authority"" and therefore
""State"" within the meaning of Article 12, it must
follow that it is subject to the constitutional
obligation under Article 14. The true scope and
ambit of Article 14 has been the subject matter of
numerous decisions and it is not necessary to
make any detailed reference to them. It is
sufficient to state that the content and reach of
Article 14 must not be confused with the doctrine
of classification."
21,"foreign jurisprudence as well. (Please see Arbier v. Connolly,
113 U. S. 27 (1885); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.,
220 U. S. 61 (1911); Railway Express Agency v. New York,
336 U. S. 106 (1949); McDonald v. Board of Election
Commissioners, 394 U. S. 802 (1969) Reed v. Reed, (1971)
404 US 76). Section 497 of IPC and Section 198(2) of CrPC
plainly fail to meet this test of equality."
22,"Hon’ble Supreme Court in Thota Sesharathamma and Anr v.
Thota Manikyamma (Dead) by Lrs. and Others, (1991) 4 SCC
312 in the following words, “Freedom of contract would yield
place to public policy envisaged above. Its effect must be
tested on the anvil of socio- economic justice, equality of
status and to oversee whether it would sub serve the
constitutional animation or frustrates. Art. 15(3) relieves
from the rigour of Art. 15(1) and charges the State to make
special provision to accord to-women socioeconomic equality."
23,"luminosity the prevalence of gender inequality in
the film industry, which compels one to
contemplate whether the fundamental conception
of gender empowerment and gender justice have
been actualized despite a number of legislations
and progressive outlook in the society or behind
the liberal exterior there is a façade which gets
uncurtained on apposite discernment. The
stubbornness of the fifth respondent, Cine
Costume Make-up Artists and Hair Dressers
Association (for short “the Association”) of
Mumbai, as is manifest, thought it appropriate to
maintain its pertinacity, possibly being
determined not to give an inch to the petitioners
who are qualified make-up artists by allowing
them to become make-up artists as members of
the Association on two grounds, namely, they are
women and, have not remained in the State of
Maharashtra for a span of five years. The first
ground indubitably offends the concept of gender
justice. As it appears though there has been
formal removal of institutionalized discrimination,
yet the mind-set and the attitude ingrained in the
subconscious have not been erased."
24,"have been a matter of history, but it has not been
so, as it seems.” It was further held as follows:
“2. Fight for the rights of women may be difficult
to trace in history but it can be stated with
certitude that there were lone and vocal voices at
many a time raising battles for the rights of
women and claiming equal treatment. Initially, in
the West, it was a fight to get the right to vote
and the debate was absolutely ineffective and, in
a way, sterile. In 1792, in England, Mary
Wollstonecraft in A Vindication of the Rights of
Women advanced a spirited plea for claiming
equality for, “the Oppressed Half of the Species”."
25,"is the influence of the good women.” Speaking
about the democracy in America, Alex De
Tocqueville wrote thus: “If I were asked … to
what singular prosperity and growing strength of
that people (Americans) ought mainly to be
attributed. I should reply; to the superiority of
their women.” One of the greatest Germans has
said: “The Eternal Feminine draws us upwards.”
4."
26,"6. Long back Charles Fourier had stated “The
extension of women's rights is the basic principle
of all social progress.”
7. At this juncture, we may refer to some
international conventions and treaties on gender
equality. The Covenant on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw),
1979, is the United Nations' landmark treaty
marking the struggle for women's right. It is
regarded as the Bill of Rights for women."
27,"Conference on Human Rights urges
governments, institutions, inter-
governmental and non-governmental
organizations to intensify their efforts
for the protection and promotion of
human rights of women and the girl
child.”
9. The other relevant international instruments on
women are: (i) Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (1948), (ii) Convention on the Political
Rights of Women (1952), (iii) International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), (iv)
International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (1966), (v) Declaration on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women (1967), (vi) Declaration on the Protection
of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed
Conflict (1974), (vii) Inter-American Convention
for the Prevention, Punishment and Elimination of
Violence against Women (1995), (viii) Universal
Declaration on Democracy (1997), and (ix)
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women (1999).”
E) In Frontiero v Richardson, (1973) 411 US 677, it was held by
the Supreme Court of the United States as follows:
“Moreover, the Government concedes that the
differential treatment accorded men and women"
28,"under these statutes serves no purpose other
than mere ""administrative convenience."" In
essence, the Government maintains that, as an
empirical matter, wives in our society frequently
are dependent upon their husbands, while
husbands rarely are dependent upon their wives. Thus, the Government argues that Congress
might reasonably have concluded that it would be
both cheaper and easier simply conclusively to
presume that wives of male members are
financially dependent upon their husbands, while
burdening female members with the task of
establishing dependency in fact. The Government
offers no concrete evidence, however, tending to
support its view that such differential treatment in
fact saves the Government any money."
29,"impugned provisions fail to meet such test and are only
liable to be struck down. F) The above provisions also cannot be held to be a measure of
reasonable classification. Going by the consistent
jurisprudence enclosed by the Supreme Court and the High
Courts, the two permissible grounds of classification are (i)
intelligible differentia (ii) rational nexus with the aim."
30,"198(2) CrPC because Section 198 (2) expressly lay down as
follows:“no person other than the husband of the woman
shall be deemed to be aggrieved by any offence punishable
under section 497 or section 498 of the said Code.” Therefore, the woman whose husband is committing adultery
is left with no remedy. Wives of those men committing
adultery are also equally aggrieved by the adulterous act. Excluding her from the purview of initiating criminal
prosecution has no rhyme or reason."
31,"married woman. In the above case, if Gayathri were not
married, the same wouldn’t be coming under the ambit of the
provision. Such exclusion is without any rational basis. I)"
32,"was contained in the penumbral regions of the
First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the
U.S. Constitution. Goldberg, J. found this right to
be embedded in the Ninth Amendment which
states that certain rights which are not
enumerated are nonetheless recognized as being
reserved to the people. White, J. found this right
in the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which prohibits the deprivation of a
person’s liberty without following due process. This view of the law was recognized and applied
in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), in which a
woman’s right to choose for herself whether or
not to abort a fetus was established, until the
fetus was found “viable”."
33,"(1925). ” It is further held that, “In my
considered opinion, “right to privacy of any
individual” is essentially a natural right, which
inheres in every human being by birth. Such right
remains with the human being till he/she breathes
last."
34,"Taking the first of these three grounds, the
offence of adultery, by its very definition, can be
committed by a man and not by a woman:
""Whoever has sexual intercourse with a person
who is and whom he knows or has reason to
believe to be the wife of another man is
guilty of the offence of adultery."" The argument
really comes to this that the definition should be
recast by extending the ambit of the offence of
adultery so that, both the man and the woman
should be punishable for the offence of adultery. Were such an argument permissible, several
provisions of the penal law might have to be
struck down on the ground that, either in their
definition or in their prescription of punishment,
they do not go far enough. For example, an
argument could be advanced as to why the
offence of robbery should be punishable with
imprisonment for ten years under section 392 of
the penal Code but the offence of adultery should
be punishable with a sentence of five years only :
'Breaking a matrimonial home is not less serious a
crime than breaking open a house'."
35,"The said reasoning is blatantly illogical. The analogy provided
is incorrect. Exempting an entire class from the purview of
criminal penalty is not analogous to providing for a particular
punishment for an offence. When an entire class of the
citizens is exempted from being punished, such an exemption
should rest on sound reasons supported by Constitutional
principles."
36,"the modification that, even the wife, who has
sexual relations with a person other than her
husband, should be made punishable for adultery. The suggested modification was not accepted by
the legislature. Mrs. Anna Chandi, who was in the
minority, voted for the deletion of Section 497 on
the ground that ""it is the right time to consider
the question whether the offence of adultery as
envisaged in Section 497 is in tune with our
present day notions of woman's status in
marriage"". The repot of the Law Commission
show that there can be two opinions on the
desirability of retaining a provision like the one
contained in Section 497 on the statute book."
37,"N) This Hon’ble Court in Sowmithri (Supra) has held as
following:
“In so far as the second of the three grounds is
concerned, section 497 does not envisage the
prosecution of the wife by the husband for
'adultery'. The offence of adultery as defined in
that section can only be committed by a man, not
by a woman. Indeed, the section provides
expressly that the wife shall not be punishable
even as an abettor."
38,"in an illicit relationship with another man is a victim and not
the author of the crime. Such a premise is illogical, arbitrary
and has no sound or rational basis. Also, if that be the case,
this Hon’ble Court has not addressed the contention as to
why a woman is not permitted to prosecute her husband,
who, even as per the observation of this Hon’ble Court is an
author of the crime. O)"
39,"has been disloyal to him has no right under the
law to prosecute his wife, in as much as by the
very definition of the offence, only a man can
commit it, not a woman. The philosophy
underlying the scheme of these provisions appears
to be that as between the husband and the wife
social good will be promoted by permitting them to
'make up' or 'break up' the matrimonial tie rather
than to drag each other to the criminal court. They
can either condone the offence in a spirit of
'forgive and forget' and live together or separate
by approaching a matrimonial court and snapping
the matrimonial tie by securing divorce. They are
not enabled to send each other to jail."
40,"“Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code and Section
198(1) read with Section 198(2) of the Criminal
Procedure Code go hand in hand and constitute a
legislative packet to deal with the offence
committed by an outsider to the matrimonial unit
who invades the peace and privacy of the
matrimonial unit and poisons the relationship
between the two partners constituting the
matrimonial unit. The community punishes the
'outsider' who breaks into the matrimonial home
and occasions the violation of sanctity of the
matrimonial tie by developing an illicit relationship
with one of the spouses subject to the rider that
the erring 'man' alone can be punished and not
the erring woman. It does not arm the two
spouses to hit each other with the weapon of
criminal law. That is why neither the husband can
prosecute the wife and send her to jail nor can
the wife to prosecute the husband and send him
to jail."
41,"far as she is not permitted to prosecute her
husband. A husband is not permitted because the
wife is not treated an offender in the eye of law. The wife is not permitted as Section 198(l) read
with section 198(2) does not permit her to do so. In the ultimate analysis the law has meted out
even handed justice to both of them in the matter
of prosecuting each other or securing the
incarceration of each other."
42,"countries in Europe, adultery is not treated as a criminal
offence. Though in some of the States of United States,
adultery is still considered as an offence most of them are
put to disuse. Recently, in the year 2015, the Supreme Court
of South Korea has struck down Article 241 of Criminal Act
(enacted as Law No. 293 of September 19, 1953) which
stipulated imprisonment for two years or less for adultery
and interdiction. The European Parliament vide resolution of
24 May 2007 on human rights in Sudan condemned the
severe punishment imposed for adultery and stated that it
“violates the basic human rights and international
obligations”.
S)"
43,"14 (1) states that “all persons shall be equal before the
courts and tribunals”. Article 26 emphatically lays down that
“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without
any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this
respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and
guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection
against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour,
sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
social origin, property, birth or other status.” Moreover, the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women, 1979 (hereinafter ‘CEDAW’) is another
peculiar instrument proscribing discrimination."
44,"PRAYER It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble
Court may be pleased to:
a) Strike down Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code,1860 as
unconstitutional being unjust, illegal and arbitrary and
violative of fundamental rights; b) Declare that Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is
unconstitutional ; c) Strike down Section 198(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 as unconstitutional being unjust, illegal
and arbitrary and violative of citizen’s fundamental rights;
