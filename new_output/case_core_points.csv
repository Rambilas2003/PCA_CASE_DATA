11,"It is well settled that Section 195(1)(b) creates a bar against
taking cognizance of offences against the administration of
justice for the purpose of guarding against baseless or vindictive
prosecutions by private parties."
11,"The provisions of this Section
imply that the Court is the only appropriate authority which is
entitled to raise grievance in relation to perjury, forgery of
documents produced before the Court, and other offences which
interfere with the effective dispensation of justice by the Court."
11,"Hence, it for the Court to exercise its discretion and consider the
suitability of making a complaint for such offences."
11,"However,
there is a pertinent difference in the wording of Section 195(1)(b)
(i) and Section 195(1)(b)(ii) inasmuch as Section 195(1)(b)(ii) is
restricted to offences which are committed in respect of a
document which is “produced or given in evidence in a proceeding
in any court”."
11,"Whereas Section 195(1)(b)(i) applies to offences
against public justice which are committed not only in any
proceeding in any court, but also “in relation to” such proceeding."
12,"When upon an application made to it in
this behalf or otherwise any Court is of opinion that it
is expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry
should be made into any offence referred to in clause
(b) of Sub­Section (1) of section 195, which appears to
have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding
in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a
document produced or given in evidence in a
proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such
preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks necessary;
(a) record a finding to that effect;
(b) make a complaint thereof in writing;
(c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having
jurisdiction;
(d) take sufficient security for the appearance for the
accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged
offence is non­bailable and the Court thinks it
necessary so to do send the accused in custody to
such Magistrate; and
(e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence
before such Magistrate."

Court (consisting of one of us) in State of Punjab v. Jasbir

document or electronic record containing a false
statement, intending that such circumstance, false
entry or false statement may appear in evidence in a
judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law
before a public servant as such, or before an
arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or
false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause
any person who in such proceeding is to form an
opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous
opinion touching any point material to the result of
such proceeding, is said “to fabricate false evidence”."

intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a
judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for
the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial
proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to
seven years, and shall also be liable to fine…
Explanation 2: An investigation directed by law
preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of Justice,
is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that
investigation may not take place before a Court of
Justice.”"
14,"In the present case, the allegation against Accused Nos."
14,"2 and
3 is that they colluded with Appellant/Accused No. 1 to create a
false sale deed, and gave false explanation of escrow arrangement
amongst the three parties, to justify how the seized currency came
to be in the Appellant’s possession."
14,"This was done to exonerate the
Appellant/Accused No. 1 and recover the seized currency at the
stage of investigation itself, which is deemed to be “a stage of a
judicial proceeding” under Explanation 2 of Section 193."
14,"Had the
genuineness of the sale deed been accepted, the Respondent may
have erroneously opined that the seized currency belonged to
Accused No. 2, and consequently abandoned proceedings under
Section 13(1)(e), PC Act against the Appellant."
14,"Therefore Section
193, IPC is squarely applicable to the allegations at hand."
15,"Hence, the primary question of law that arises for
our consideration in these appeals is whether
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC bars lodging of case by
the investigating agency under Section 193, IPC,
in respect of offence of giving false evidence which
is committed at the stage of investigation, prior to
production of such evidence before the Trial
Court?"
15,"Whether an offence under Section 193, IPC
committed at the stage of investigation, prior to
production of the false evidence before the Trial
Court by a person who is not yet party to
proceedings before the Trial Court, is an offence
“in relation to” a proceeding in any court under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
6.2 Whether the words “stage of a judicial proceeding”
under Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC can be
equated with “proceeding in any court” under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
15"
16,"This Court in
Sachida Nand Singh (supra) has held that Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
read with Section 340(1), CrPC will only apply in respect of
offences which are committed during the time when the
document concerned was custodia legis or in the custody of the
Court."
16,"The contention of the appellants is that if the
offence alleged is with respect to a document which
reached the Court then the aforesaid bar operates, no
matter whether the offence was committed before or
after its production in court."
17,"Section 190 of the Code
empowers “any magistrate of the first class” to take
cognizance of “any offence” upon receiving a
complaint, or police report or information or upon his
own knowledge."
18,"10…It has to be noted that Section 340 falls within
Chapter XXVI of the Code which contains a fasciculus
of “Provisions as to offences affecting the
administration of justice” as the title of the chapter
appellates."
18,"So the offences envisaged in Section
195(1)(b) of the Code must involve acts which would
have affected the administration of justice.
11."
18,"The scope of the preliminary enquiry envisaged in
Section 340(1) of the Code is to ascertain whether any
offence affecting administration of justice has been
committed in respect of a document produced in
court or given in evidence in a proceeding in that
Court."
18,"In other words, the offence should have been
committed during the time when the document was
in custodia legis."
18,"It would be a strained thinking that any offence
involving forgery of a document if committed far
outside the precincts of the Court and long before its
production in the Court, could also be treated as one
affecting administration of justice merely because
that document later reached the court records."
19,"subsequently a prosecution was launched against
him for offences under Sections 467 and 471 of IPC
through a private complaint."
19,"“The offences about which the court alone is clothed
with the right to complain may, therefore, be
appropriately considered to be only those offences
committed by a party to a proceeding in that court,
the commission of which has a reasonably close
nexus with the proceedings in that court so that it
can without embarking upon a completely
independent and fresh inquiry, satisfactorily consider
by reference principally to its records the expediency
of prosecuting the delinquent party."
19,"It, therefore,
appears to be more appropriate to adopt the strict
construction of confirming the prohibition contained
in Section 195(1)(c) only to those cases in which the
offences specified therein were committed by a party
to the proceeding in the character as such party.”
14."
19,"After stating so their Lordships proceeded to
observe that the legislature could not have intended
to extend the prohibition in the sub­section to
offences committed by a party to the proceedings
prior to his becoming such a party."
20,"The provision is intended to bar the right to initiate
prosecution only where the offence committed has a reasonably
close nexus with the court proceedings, such that the Court can
independently determine the need for an inquiry into the offence
with reference to its own records."
20,"Therefore, the offence must be
such that directly impacts administration of justice by the Court."
20,"This would certainly be the case if the document was in the
custody of the Court at the time of commission of offence."
20,"However, the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(ii) cannot be read as
operating even in cases where the offence against administration
of justice was committed in respect of a document
1) outside of the Court,
2) by a person who was not yet party to the Court proceedings,
and,
3) at a time long before the production of the document before
the Court."
21,"The
prohibition contained in Section 195(1)(b)(i) should not be
extended to provide protection to a person who has been accused
of tendering false evidence during the investigative stage prior to
becoming a party to the court proceedings and producing such
evidence before the Court."
21,"The view taken in Sachida Nand Singh was
subsequently affirmed by the Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh
Marwah (supra)."
21,"The
Metropolitan Magistrate in that case held that both Sections
195(1)(b)(i) and (ii), CrPC operated as a bar against taking
cognizance of these offences."
22,"Surjit
Singh had held that the bar against taking cognizance under
Section 195(1)(b)(ii) would apply even if the offences stipulated
therein were committed prior to production of the document
before the Court, if such document was subsequently produced
before the Court."
22,"that the offence should be
such which has direct bearing or affects the
functioning or discharge of lawful duties of a public
servant or has a direct correlation with the
proceedings in a court of justice, the expression
“when such offence is alleged to have been committed
in respect of a document produced or given in
evidence in a proceeding in any court” occurring in
clause (b)(ii) should normally mean commission of
such an offence after the document has actually been
produced or given in evidence in the court."
22,"The
situation or contingency where an offence as
enumerated in this clause has already been
committed earlier and later on the document is
produced or is given in evidence in court, does not
appear to be in tune with clauses (a)(i) and (b)(i) and
22"
23,"This indicates that clause (b)(ii) contemplates a
situation where the offences enumerated therein are
committed with respect to a document subsequent to
its production or giving in evidence in a proceeding in
any court."
23,"11…The fact that the procedure for filing a complaint
by court has been provided in Chapter XXVI dealing
with offences affecting administration of justice, is a
clear pointer to the legislative intent that the offence
committed should be of such type which directly
affects the administration of justice viz."
23,"which is
committed after the document is produced or given in
evidence in court."
23,"Any offence committed with respect
to a document at a time prior to its production or
giving in evidence in court cannot, strictly speaking,
be said to be an offence affecting the administration
of justice."
23,"[AIR 1931 All 443 : 32
Cri LJ 1105 (SB)] considered the scope of the
aforesaid provision and held, that clause (c) of Section
195(1) applies only to cases where an offence is
committed by a party, as such, to a proceeding to any
court in respect of a document which has been
produced or given in evidence in such proceeding."
23,"It
was held that an offence which has already been
committed by a person who does not become a party
till, say, 30 years after the commission of the offence,
cannot be said to have been committed by a party
within the meaning of clause (c)."
24,"in considerable detail observed that as a general rule
the courts consider it expedient in the interest of
justice to start prosecutions as contemplated by
Section 476 (of the old Code which now corresponds
to Section 340 CrPC) only if there is a reasonable
foundation for the charge and there is a reasonable
likelihood of conviction."
24,"The requirement of a finding
as to the expediency is understandable in case of an
offence alleged to have been committed either in or in
relation to a proceeding in that court in case of
offences specified in clause (b)"
24,"[of the old Code
corresponding to clause (b)(i) CrPC] because of the
close nexus between the offence and the proceeding."
24,"In case of offences specified in clause (c), they are
required to be committed by a party to a proceeding
in that court with respect to a document produced or
given in evidence in that court."
24,"These offences have been selected for the court's
control because of their direct impact on the judicial
process."
24,"It is the judicial process or the
administration of public justice which is the direct
and immediate object or the victim of these offences."
24,"As the purity of the proceedings of the court is
directly sullied by the crime, the court is considered
to be the only party entitled to consider the
desirability of complaining against the guilty party."
25,"The Magistrate took cognizance of the offence
on 27­9­1983."
25,"[AIR 1950 PC 31: 51 Cri LJ 651]
and Sushil Kumar v. State of Haryana [1987 Supp
SCC 654: 1988 SCC (Cri) 136 : AIR 1988 SC 419]
wherein it has been held that the bar of Section 195
would not apply if the original document had not
been produced or given in evidence in court."
26,"Since the object of deletion of the words “by a
party to any proceeding in any court” occurring in
Section 195(1)(c) of the old Code is to afford
protection to witnesses also, the interpretation placed
on the said provision in the earlier decisions would
still hold good."
26,"Section 195(1)(b)(ii) CrPC would be
attracted only when the offences enumerated in the
said provision have been committed with respect to a
document after it has been produced or given in
evidence in a proceeding in any court i.e. during the
time when the document was in custodia legis.”
(emphasis supplied)"
27,"The Court reiterated the test laid down in
Sachida Nand Singh, i.e., that the offence in respect of which
only the Court can make a complaint must be one which has a
direct correlation to, or a direct impact on, proceedings before a
court of justice."
27,"The Court further noted that the situation wherein the
offence as enumerated under Section 195(1)(b)(ii) has been
committed earlier, but the document is produced later in court is
not in consonance with the object of Sections 195(1)(b)(i) either."
27,"Even in Surjit Singh, this Court had held on the facts of that
case, that since the criminal Court had taken cognizance of the
offence long before filing of the original document before the civil
Court, the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(ii) would not apply."
28,"This Court in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai had
noted that even under Section 192(b) of the 1898 Code
(corresponding to Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC), the offence
committed is one with a “close nexus” to the court proceedings."
28,"The words “in relation to” under Section 195(1)(b(i) appear
to encompass situations wherein false evidence has been
fabricated prior to being produced before a Court of law, for the
purpose of being used in proceedings before the Court."
28,"The
appellants in that case claimed that the respondents/accused
had given false evidence and forged debit notes and books of
28"
29,"Subsequently, the appellants took the plea that offences under
Section 195(1)(b)(ii) were also made out:
“13."
29,"The point forcefully argued by the learned
Counsel on behalf of the Appellants is that his
clients, being victims of forgery, ought not to be
rendered remediless in respect of the acts of forgery
which are committed before they are used as evidence
in a court proceeding, and that therefore, a private
complaint would be maintainable in the fact
circumstance mentioned in the two criminal
complaints referred to hereinabove."
29,"The Court has
thus to steer between two opposite poles of a
spectrum the “yin” being the protection of a person
from frivolous criminal complaints, and the “yang”
being the right of a victim to ventilate his grievance
and have the Court try the offence of forgery by
means of a private complaint."
29,"This Court thereafter proceeded to distinguish between
the offence of fabricating false evidence under Sections 192 and
29"
30,"193, IPC and the offence of forgery."
30,"It noted that the averments
made by the appellants in their complaints pertained exclusively
to giving of false evidence and did not disclose the ingredients of
forgery as defined under the IPC."
30,"Even though the false evidence was created outside of the
Court, it was by the appellants’ own admission, created “in
relation to” proceedings before the Court."
30,"At this stage, it is important to understand the
difference between the offences mentioned in Section
195(1)(b)(i) and"
30,"What is
important is that once these Sections of the Indian
Penal Code are attracted, the offence should be
alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to,
any proceeding in any Court."
30,"Thus, what is clear is
that the offence punishable under these Sections
does not have to be committed only in any proceeding
in any Court but can also be an offence alleged to
have been committed in relation to any proceeding in
any Court."
31,"of offences described in Section 463, and punishable
under Sections 471, 475 or 476 of the Indian Penal
Code, when such offences are alleged to have been
committed in respect of a document produced or
given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court."
31,"What
is conspicuous by its absence in Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
are the words “or in relation to”, making it clear that
if the provisions of Section 195(1)(b)(ii) are attracted,
then the offence alleged to have been committed must
be committed in respect of a document that is
custodia legis, and not an offence that may have
occurred prior to the document being introduced in
court proceedings."
31,"The
presence of “in relation to” under Section 195(1)(b)(i) means that
Iqbal Singh Marwah would not have blanket application to
every case where a complaint is lodged in respect of an offence
specified under that Section."
31,"However, on the facts of Bandekar
Brothers, this was not a situation in which the offence
complained of did not have a “reasonably close nexus” with the
court proceedings."
31,"The offence of giving false evidence was
committed by the respondents, who were party to the court
proceedings, for the purpose of leading the Court to form an
31"
32,"Hence it could be said that though the offence was
not committed during the course of the court proceedings, it was
certainly committed “in relation to” such proceedings."
32,"The respondent filed a private
complaint under Section 340, CrPC alleging offence punishable
under Sections 193 and 419, IPC."
32,"In the instant case, the false affidavit alleged to
have been filed by the appellant was in a proceeding
pending before the civil court and the offence falls
under Section 193 IPC and the proceeding ought to
have been initiated on the complaint in writing by
that court under Section 195(1)(b)(i) IPC."
32,"Since the
offence is said to have been committed in relation to
or in a proceeding in a civil court, the case of Iqbal
Singh Marwah is not applicable to the instant case.”
32"
33,"Therefore, this Court expressly observed in Kailash
Mangal that since the document was filed during the course of a
proceeding which was already pending before the court, the
offence could be said to have been committed “in relation to” such
proceeding for the purpose of Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC."
33,"The
requirement of reasonable nexus between the offence and the
proceeding before the Court was clearly satisfied in that case."
33,"The Division Bench held that
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC covers a different category of offence
and is therefore distinct from Section 195(1)(b)(ii)."
33,"However, on the facts of that case, this was again a
situation wherein at the first instance, the Court was allegedly
33"
34,"persuaded to form an opinion based on certain false evidence
which was produced by persons who were already party to the
proceedings."
34,"In neither of the abovementioned decisions has this
Court authoritatively considered the specific issue of preserving
the right of an investigative agency, such as the Respondent in
the present case, to initiate complaints against persons who have
fabricated false evidence during the course of criminal
proceedings.
13."
34,"The moot point therefore, as mentioned in Para
Nos. 6 & 6.1, is whether offence committed
under Section 193, IPC during the stage of
investigation, prior to commencement of
proceedings before the Trial Court, by a person
34"
35,"who is not yet party to proceedings before the
Trial Court, is an offence committed “in relation
to” such proceedings for the purpose of the bar
under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
14."
35,"The construction of the words “in relation to” must be
controlled by the overarching principle applicable to Section
195(1)(b), CrPC as stated in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai (supra)
and Sachida Nand Singh (supra), which was affirmed by the
Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra)."
35,"That is,
even if the offence is committed prior to giving of the fabricated
evidence in court, it must have a direct or reasonably close nexus
with the court proceedings."
35,"Looking to the decision in Bandekar Brothers (supra),
is true to say that Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC may be attracted to
the offence of fabricating false evidence prior to its production
before the Court, provided that such evidence is led by a person
who is party to the court proceedings, for the purpose of leading
the Court to form a certain opinion based on such evidence."
36,"also apply where a person who is initially not a party to the court
proceedings fabricates certain evidence, and
1) subsequently becomes a party and produces it before the
Court; or;
2) falsely deposes as a witness before the Court on the strength of
such evidence,
for the purpose of causing the Court to form an erroneous
opinion on a point material to the result of the proceedings."
36,"However, where a person fabricates false evidence for the
purpose of misleading the investigating officer, this may not have
any direct nexus with the subsequent court proceedings."
36,"There is
an indirect nexus inasmuch as if the investigating agency does
not suspect any wrongdoing, and the Court commits the case for
trial, the evidence will be produced for the Court’s perusal and
impact the judicial decision­making process."
36,"However, it may be
equally possible that even if the fabricated evidence appears
sufficiently convincing, the investigating agency may drop
proceedings against the accused and divert its time and
resources elsewhere."
36,"Therefore, the offence may never reach the
stage of court proceedings."
37,"light that the evidence was falsely adduced, it will be the
investigating agency which will suffer loss of face and be forced to
conduct a fresh investigation."
37,"Hence, though the offence is one
which affects the administration of justice, it is the investigating
agency, and not the Court, which is the aggrieved party in such
circumstance.
17."
37,"In this regard, we consider it beneficial to refer to the
portion of the opinion expressed by the Constitution Bench in
Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra) as to why a narrow interpretation
of Section 195(1)(b)(ii), CrPC was necessary to avoid
impracticality or injustice in its implementation:
“23…Before filing of the complaint, the court may
hold a preliminary enquiry and record a finding to the
effect that it is expedient in the interests of justice
that enquiry should be made into any of the offences
referred to in Section 195(1)(b)."
37,"This expediency will
normally be judged by the court by weighing not the
magnitude of injury suffered by the person affected
by such forgery or forged document, but having
regard to the effect or impact, such commission of
offence has upon administration of justice."
37,"It is
possible that such forged document or forgery may
cause a very serious or substantial injury to a person
in the sense that it may deprive him of a very
valuable property or status or the like, but such
document may be just a piece of evidence produced
or given in evidence in court, where voluminous
evidence may have been adduced and the effect of
such piece of evidence on the broad concept of
37"
38,"The broad view of clause (b)(ii), as
canvassed by learned counsel for the appellants,
would render the victim of such forgery or forged
document remediless."
38,"Any interpretation which leads
to a situation where a victim of a crime is rendered
remediless, has to be discarded."
38,"Delay in prosecution of a guilty person comes
to his advantage as witnesses become reluctant to
give evidence and the evidence gets lost."
39,"It will not be fair and proper to give an
interpretation which leads to a situation where a
person alleged to have committed an offence of the
type enumerated in clause (b)(ii) is either not placed
for trial on account of non­filing of a complaint or if a
complaint is filed, the same does not come to its
logical end."
40,"Just like a private party who has been a victim of
forgery committed outside the precincts of the Court, the
investigative agency should not be left remediless against persons
who have producing false evidence for the purpose of interfering
with the investigation process."
40,"Moreover, the present case
concerns offences alleged to have been committed under the PC
Act."
40,"The first is one in which the investigative agency, on
the basis of false/fabricated material drops the case."
40,"Subsequently, it is brought to their notice that the evidence was
40"
41,"In both scenarios, the Court has not had an
opportunity to consider the allegedly fabricated evidence, as trial
has not yet commenced in respect of the offence."
41,"Hence it would
not be possible for the Court to independently ascertain the need
for lodging a complaint under Section 195(1)(b)(i) read with
Section 340, CrPC when the evidence alleged to have been
falsified is not even present on its records."
41,"In case the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(i) is applied to
offences committed during the course of investigation, the Court
may think it fit to wait till the completion of trial to evaluate
whether a complaint should be made or not."
41,"Subsequently, the
Court may be of the opinion that in the larger scheme of things
the alleged fabrication of evidence during investigation has not
had any material impact on the trial, and decline to initiate
prosecution for the same."
42,"This may give the offender under
Section 193, IPC sufficient time to fabricate more falsehoods to
hide the original crime."
42,"Further, irrespective of the potential
impact that such false evidence may have on the opinion formed
by the trial court, the investigating agency has a separate right to
proceed against the accused for attempting to obstruct fair and
transparent probe into a criminal offence."
42,"It must be clarified that the aforementioned opinion
expressed by us is limited to factual situations such as the
present case wherein the fabricated evidence has been detected
prior to commencement of the trial, or without such trial having
been initiated in the first place."
42,"The same may not apply for
example, where the investigation agency on the basis of false
evidence given by a third party happens to wrongfully implicate a
person, other than the real perpetrator, for a particular offence."
43,"Since by this stage, the evidence has been produced before the
Court, and contains potential for directly impacting the formation
of the Court’s opinion on the innocence or guilt of the accused
person, invoking the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(i) may not give
rise to much difficulty."
43,"In that case it was alleged that the investigating
officers themselves (including the appellant therein) had
abducted and murdered an advocate and his family, and falsely
implicated another person for this offence."
43,"The case involving the
falsely accused person had already been committed for trial when
this Court, in writ proceedings initiated by the Punjab and
43"
44,"The CBI then filed a chargesheet before the designated trial
court in that case under Sections 193 and 211, IPC."
44,"This Court in Arvindervir Singh clarified that challan was
to be filed directly by the CBI only in respect of the offence of
abduction and murder alleged to have been committed by the
appellant­accused."
44,"So far as the offence punishable under
Sections 193 and 211, IPC was concerned it was for the
designated trial court to make a written complaint to a Magistrate
having jurisdiction."
45,"This
gives rise to the question of whether an offence committed during
the investigation, which is a “stage of a judicial proceeding”
under Explanation 2, Section 193, IPC, would be an offence
committed “in relation to any proceeding in any Court” under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC.
45"
46,"The purpose of Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC is
evidently to ensure that a person who fabricates false evidence
before an investigating or inquiring authority prior to the trial of
the case does not escape penalty."
46,"However, whether the
commission of such offence would require the complaint of a
Court under Section 195(1)(b)(i) would depend upon the authority
before whom such false evidence is given."
46,"For example, if a
person gives false evidence in an inquiry before the Magistrate
under Section 200, CrPC, that would undoubtedly be an offence
committed before a Court under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC."
46,"However, this would not be the case where false evidence is led
before an investigating officer prior to the Court having taken
cognizance of the offence or the case being committed for trial."
46,"20.2 The object and purpose of Section 195(1)(b), CrPC must
be borne in mind whilst determining whether the fabrication of
false evidence during a stage of a judicial proceeding amounts to
having made such fabrication in relation to a proceeding before
the Court."
47,"in respect of certain offences to public servants, or to the relevant
Court, as they are considered to be the only party who is directly
aggrieved or impacted by those offences."
47,"Furthermore, for the
purpose of Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC, there must be an intention
on part of the alleged offender to directly mislead the Court into
forming a certain opinion by commission of offence under Section
193, IPC."
47,"Though a criminal investigation is certainly a stage of a
judicial proceeding insofar as it may culminate in issue of
process and trial against the accused, it would not be a
proceeding in relation to a certain Court under Section 195(1)(b)
(i), CrPC before the Court has even taken judicial notice of such
investigation."
48,"Therefore, a private complaint
would not be maintainable in respect of a false statement given
on oath before the Income Tax Officer."
48,"In Babita Lila and Another v. Union of India, (2016)
9 SCC 647, a Division Bench of this Court similarly considered
the jurisdiction of the Deputy Director of Income Tax to make a
complaint under Section 195(1)(b), CrPC in respect of false
statements given on oath during a search operation conducted
under the Income Tax Act, 1961."
49,"1 SCC 466, a three­Judge Bench of this
Court was faced with the issue of whether 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC
would bar a complaint under Sections 193, 199 and 201 of the
IPC alleging making of false statements in affidavit before the
Rent Control Officer under the U.P, Urban Buildings (Regulation
of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972."
50,"Therefore,
if any false evidence was given during the course of such
proceedings, only the Rent Control Officer was authorized to
make complaint of the same under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC."
51,"Therefore, if the
offence under Section 193, IPC is committed before such an
authority, the written complaint of that authority is mandatorily
required for trial of the offence."
51,"However, the facts of the
decisions in Lalji Haridas (supra), Babita Lila (supra) and
Chandrapal Singh (supra), are clearly distinguishable from the
present appeal as they all involve 1) False statements made on
oath or in affidavits, 2) in a judicial proceeding and 3) before an
authority which is expressly deemed under law to be a “court”."
51,"None of the aforequoted cases were concerned with fabrication of
evidence before an investigating authority under a penal statute."
52,be paid back to Accused No. 2.
52,"Had the Respondent accepted
the veracity of the contents of this letter, they would not only
have dropped the investigation against Appellant/Accused No. 1
but also wrongfully returned the seized currency under the
mistaken impression that it was the property of Accused No. 2."
52,"The Accused No. 2 would have then facilitated the return of the
Appellant’s ill­gotten gains back to his custody."
52,"Therefore in the present case, it is not the Trial Court
but the Respondent authority/agency which has been directly
impacted due to fabrication of evidence by the
Appellants/accused."
52,"The Appellants’ intention was not to mislead
the Trial Court, at least not at the first instance."
53,"goal was to ensure that the Appellant/Accused No. 1 was cleared
of wrongdoing at the stage of investigation itself."
53,"It was after
being charged under Section 193, IPC, that the
Appellants/accused reiterated the fictitious escrow arrangement
story before the Trial Court so as to prove their innocence."
53,"Hence
it cannot be said that the offence under Sections 120B read with
193, IPC was committed by the Appellants “in relation to” a
proceeding in a court under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC."
53,"22.2 Section 2(i), CrPC defines “judicial proceeding” as
including any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or
may be legally taken by oath."
53,"However, neither was the
fabricated evidence in the present case given on oath before the
investigating officer, nor is the investigating authority under the
PC Act deemed to be a “court” for the purpose of Section 195(1)
(b), CrPC."
54,"22.3 Had this been a case wherein the Respondent had not
developed any suspicion against Accused Nos. 2 and 3, and the
Trial Court had subsequently discovered the subterfuge caused
by them, we may have taken a different view."
54,"As we have noted in
paragraph 18 (supra), where the fabrication of evidence has
escaped the scrutiny of the investigating agency, and the case is
subsequently brought to trial, such evidence would have direct
bearing on the trial court’s opinion and hence the bar under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC may be applicable."
54,"However, in the
present case, the investigating agency has been sagacious
enough to detect the commission of offence under Section 193,
IPC at the preliminary stage."
54,"Thus, the questions of law stated in paragraph 6 (supra)
stand answered against the Appellants/accused."
55,"The High Court
has rightly observed that the Appellant/Accused No. 1 had not
raised the defence of holding the money in escrow for Accused
Nos."
55,This defence was raised by Accused Nos.
55,"2 and 3 at a
highly belated stage on 4.02.2002, almost a year after the
recovery of the seized currency, though the Appellant had
corresponded with Accused No. 2 in May­June, 2001."
55,"Hence it is apparent that the Appellants/accused
entered into an elaborate conspiracy and attempted to create a
false circumstance of escrow transaction for the purpose of
shielding Appellant/Accused No. 1 from prosecution."
55,"In fact, the
High Court has shown great lenity by reducing the sentences
awarded to the Appellants/accused in view of their advanced age
55"
56,"In view of the gravity of the
offence, no further benefit can be granted to them in this regard."
56,"The questions of law formulated in paragraph 6
(supra) are answered as follows:
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC will not bar
prosecution by the investigating agency for offence
punishable under Section 193, IPC, which is
committed during the stage of investigation."
56,"This is
provided that the investigating agency has lodged
complaint or registered the case under Section 193,
IPC prior to commencement of proceedings and
production of such evidence before the trial court."
56,"In such circumstance, the same would not be
considered an offence committed in, or in relation
to, any proceeding in any Court for the purpose of
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC."
