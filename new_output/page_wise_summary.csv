Versus
State, rep."
2,"2. These appeals arise out of judgment dated 6.01.2020 in
Crl. A. Nos. 1089, 1090 and 1091 of 2007 passed by the High
Court of Judicature at Madras (“High Court”). Since they involve
common facts and question of law, appeal arising out of S.L.P.

3,"9.03.2001 a separate disproportionate assets case was registered
against him under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the PC Act. It is this case that forms the factual crux of the present appeal. 3.2 During the course of investigation, Accused No. 2 V.S.
Krishnan (Appellant in the connected appeal arising out of S.L.P.

4,"agreement of sale could not be executed. Hence Accused Nos. 2
and 3 sought recovery of the seized currency. Accused No. 2 produced the purported sale deed dated
24.01.2001 (in duplicate) typed out on stamp paper before the
Investigating Officer in support of their claim."
5,"No. 4 stamp vendor S. Mohankumar, through whom the stamp
papers of the sale deed were issued on 11.01.2001, was cancelled
on 7.10.1992. No stamp paper of any denomination had been
issued to him during the period of 1998 to 2001. Therefore, the
Respondent’s claim is that the Appellant conspired with Accused
Nos. 2­4 to fabricate false deed of agreement for sale for the
purpose of being shielded from legal action in the
disproportionate assets case."
6,"Meenakshi Marwah and Another, (2005) 4 SCC 370. Furthermore, based on the evidence on the record, the Trial
Court found that it was not proved that Accused No. 2 had
entrusted the seized currency to the Appellant for holding in
escrow till completion of sale transaction by Accused No. 3. Hence, the Trial Court convicted the Appellant under Section
13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act; as well as Sections
120B and 193 of the IPC, and sentenced him to rigorous
imprisonment for two years and payment of fine of Rs 1.5 lakhs. Accused Nos."
7,"affect administration of justice, i.e. pertaining to documents
which are custodia legis. Thus, the offence must be committed
after a document is produced in evidence before the Court. Therefore Sections 195(1)(b)(i) and 340, CrPC will not be
applicable in the present case where documents were fabricated
during the investigative phase prior to their production during
before the Trial Court. The High Court relied upon the decision of a three­Judge
Bench of this Court in Sachida Nand Singh and Another v.
State of Bihar and Another, (1998) 2 SCC 493, and the later
Constitution Bench decision in Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra)
which affirmed the view taken in Sachida Nand Singh, while
laying down its opinion."
8,"disproportionate assets case. However, taking into consideration
the advanced age of the Accused and the long passage of time
since taking of cognizance of the case, the sentences awarded to
the Accused were reduced. Nevertheless, the Accused have come
before us in the present appeals challenging the impugned
judgment of the High Court. 4. Learned senior counsel Mr. Basava Prabhu Patil, and
learned counsel Mr. Amit Anand Tiwari and Mr. B. Karunakaran
appearing for the Appellants/Accused, have forcefully argued
that Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC cannot be construed as analogous
to Section 195(1)(b)(ii)."
9,"proceedings before a Court of law. Therefore, the prosecution
lodged by the Respondent agency against the Accused under
Section 193, IPC is unsustainable. 4.1 Per contra, learned Additional Solicitor General
appearing for the Respondent, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, has
contended that the holding in Iqbal Singh Marwah is applicable
in respect of Section 195(1)(b)(i) of the CrPC as well. She has also
sought to distinguish Bandekar Brothers (supra) and other
decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the
Appellants/Accused on the ground that these were rendered in
the particular facts of those cases, and will not apply to the
present case."
10,"such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or
in relation to, any proceeding in any Court,
or
(ii) of any offence described in section 463, or
punishable under section 471, section 475 or section
476, of the said Code, when such offence is alleged to
have been committed in respect of a document
produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any
Court,
or
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit, or attempt
to commit, or the abetment of, any offence specified
in sub­clause (i) or sub­clause (ii),
except on the complaint in writing of that Court or by
such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise
in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to
which that Court is subordinate. xxx
(3) In clause (b) of Sub­Section (1), the term “Court”
means a Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court, and
includes a tribunal constituted by or under a Central,
provincial or State Act if declared by that Act to be a
Court for the purposes of this section.”
(emphasis supplied)
10"
11,"It is well settled that Section 195(1)(b) creates a bar against
taking cognizance of offences against the administration of
justice for the purpose of guarding against baseless or vindictive
prosecutions by private parties. The provisions of this Section
imply that the Court is the only appropriate authority which is
entitled to raise grievance in relation to perjury, forgery of
documents produced before the Court, and other offences which
interfere with the effective dispensation of justice by the Court. Hence, it for the Court to exercise its discretion and consider the
suitability of making a complaint for such offences. However,
there is a pertinent difference in the wording of Section 195(1)(b)
(i) and Section 195(1)(b)(ii) inasmuch as Section 195(1)(b)(ii) is
restricted to offences which are committed in respect of a
document which is “produced or given in evidence in a proceeding
in any court”."
12,"5.1 Section 340, CrPC prescribes the procedure to be
followed for recording a complaint under Section 195(1)(b):
“340. Procedure in cases mentioned in section
195.—(1) When upon an application made to it in
this behalf or otherwise any Court is of opinion that it
is expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry
should be made into any offence referred to in clause
(b) of Sub­Section (1) of section 195, which appears to
have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding
in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a
document produced or given in evidence in a
proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such
preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks necessary;
(a) record a finding to that effect;
(b) make a complaint thereof in writing;
(c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having
jurisdiction;
(d) take sufficient security for the appearance for the
accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged
offence is non­bailable and the Court thinks it
necessary so to do send the accused in custody to
such Magistrate; and
(e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence
before such Magistrate. xxx

13,"Section 340, CrPC prior to making a complaint under Section
195, for consideration of a larger Bench. Therefore, we shall be
limiting our findings to the issue of whether written complaint by
the Trial
Court was required under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC in the
present case, without delving extensively into the aspect of
whether preliminary inquiry was required to be conducted prior
to such complaint. 5.2 We also find it necessary to consider Sections 192 and
193 of the IPC for the purpose of deciding this matter."
14,"193. Punishment for false evidence. Whoever
intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a
judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for
the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial
proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to
seven years, and shall also be liable to fine…
Explanation 2: An investigation directed by law
preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of Justice,
is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that
investigation may not take place before a Court of
Justice.” In the present case, the allegation against Accused Nos."
15,"6. Hence, the primary question of law that arises for
our consideration in these appeals is whether
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC bars lodging of case by
the investigating agency under Section 193, IPC,
in respect of offence of giving false evidence which
is committed at the stage of investigation, prior to
production of such evidence before the Trial
Court? This in turn, requires us to resolve the
following sub­questions:
6.1 Whether an offence under Section 193, IPC
committed at the stage of investigation, prior to
production of the false evidence before the Trial
Court by a person who is not yet party to
proceedings before the Trial Court, is an offence
“in relation to” a proceeding in any court under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
6.2 Whether the words “stage of a judicial proceeding”
under Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC can be
equated with “proceeding in any court” under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
15"
16,"I. General overview of the law on Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
7. Before answering the questions stated in paragraph 6
(supra), it may be useful to refer to the landmark precedents of
this Court which have considered similar issues arising under
Section 195(1)(b)(ii), CrPC. The issue of whether Section 195(1)(b)
(ii), CrPC is applicable to documents which are forged prior to
their production in Court is no longer res integra. This Court in
Sachida Nand Singh (supra) has held that Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
read with Section 340(1), CrPC will only apply in respect of
offences which are committed during the time when the
document concerned was custodia legis or in the custody of the
Court."
17,"for obvious reasons. Section 190 of the Code
empowers “any magistrate of the first class” to take
cognizance of “any offence” upon receiving a
complaint, or police report or information or upon his
own knowledge. Section 195 restricts such general
powers of the magistrate, and the general right of a
person to move the court with a complaint is to that
extent curtailed. It is a well­recognised canon of
interpretation that provision curbing the general
jurisdiction of the court must normally receive strict
interpretation unless the statute or the context
requires otherwise (Abdul Waheed Khan v. Bhawani"
18,"10…It has to be noted that Section 340 falls within
Chapter XXVI of the Code which contains a fasciculus
of “Provisions as to offences affecting the
administration of justice” as the title of the chapter
appellates. So the offences envisaged in Section
195(1)(b) of the Code must involve acts which would
have affected the administration of justice.
11. The scope of the preliminary enquiry envisaged in
Section 340(1) of the Code is to ascertain whether any
offence affecting administration of justice has been
committed in respect of a document produced in
court or given in evidence in a proceeding in that
Court. In other words, the offence should have been
committed during the time when the document was
in custodia legis."
19,"subsequently a prosecution was launched against
him for offences under Sections 467 and 471 of IPC
through a private complaint. The ratio of the decision
therein is the following: (SCC Headnote) “The offences about which the court alone is clothed
with the right to complain may, therefore, be
appropriately considered to be only those offences
committed by a party to a proceeding in that court,
the commission of which has a reasonably close
nexus with the proceedings in that court so that it
can without embarking upon a completely
independent and fresh inquiry, satisfactorily consider
by reference principally to its records the expediency
of prosecuting the delinquent party. It, therefore,
appears to be more appropriate to adopt the strict
construction of confirming the prohibition contained
in Section 195(1)(c) only to those cases in which the
offences specified therein were committed by a party
to the proceeding in the character as such party.”
14."
20,"clear. The provision is intended to bar the right to initiate
prosecution only where the offence committed has a reasonably
close nexus with the court proceedings, such that the Court can
independently determine the need for an inquiry into the offence
with reference to its own records. Therefore, the offence must be
such that directly impacts administration of justice by the Court. This would certainly be the case if the document was in the
custody of the Court at the time of commission of offence."
21,"Though these observations in Sachida Nand Singh were
made in the context of Section 195(1)(b)(ii), we find that they have
useful application in interpreting Section 195(1)(b)(i) as well. The
prohibition contained in Section 195(1)(b)(i) should not be
extended to provide protection to a person who has been accused
of tendering false evidence during the investigative stage prior to
becoming a party to the court proceedings and producing such
evidence before the Court. 8. The view taken in Sachida Nand Singh was
subsequently affirmed by the Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh
Marwah (supra)."
22,"Section 195(1)(b)(ii) would not apply where forgery of a document
was committed before producing the said document in court. However, it was noticed that Sachida Nand Singh appeared to
conflict with an earlier three­Judge Bench decision in Surjit
Singh and Others v. Balbir Singh, (1996) 3 SCC 533. Surjit
Singh had held that the bar against taking cognizance under
Section 195(1)(b)(ii) would apply even if the offences stipulated
therein were committed prior to production of the document
before the Court, if such document was subsequently produced
before the Court. The Constitution Bench clarified the position of
law as follows:
“10…This being the scheme of two provisions or
clauses of Section 195 viz."
23,"consequently with the scheme of Section 195 CrPC. This indicates that clause (b)(ii) contemplates a
situation where the offences enumerated therein are
committed with respect to a document subsequent to
its production or giving in evidence in a proceeding in
any court. 11…The fact that the procedure for filing a complaint
by court has been provided in Chapter XXVI dealing
with offences affecting administration of justice, is a
clear pointer to the legislative intent that the offence
committed should be of such type which directly
affects the administration of justice viz. which is
committed after the document is produced or given in
evidence in court."
24,"in considerable detail observed that as a general rule
the courts consider it expedient in the interest of
justice to start prosecutions as contemplated by
Section 476 (of the old Code which now corresponds
to Section 340 CrPC) only if there is a reasonable
foundation for the charge and there is a reasonable
likelihood of conviction. The requirement of a finding
as to the expediency is understandable in case of an
offence alleged to have been committed either in or in
relation to a proceeding in that court in case of
offences specified in clause (b) [of the old Code
corresponding to clause (b)(i) CrPC] because of the
close nexus between the offence and the proceeding. In case of offences specified in clause (c), they are
required to be committed by a party to a proceeding
in that court with respect to a document produced or
given in evidence in that court."
25,"18. The other case which is the sheet anchor of the
argument of learned counsel for the appellants is
Surjit Singh v. Balbir Singh. The facts as stated in
paras 1 and 11 of the Report show that a criminal
complaint was filed by the respondent under Sections
420, 467, 468, 471 read with 120­B IPC alleging that
the appellants had conspired and fabricated an
agreement dated 26­7­1978 and had forged the
signature of Smt Dalip Kaur and on the basis thereof,
they had made a claim to remain in possession of a
house. The Magistrate took cognizance of the offence
on 27­9­1983."
26,"proceed with the trial of the criminal case was upheld
and the appeal was dismissed. 20. Since the object of deletion of the words “by a
party to any proceeding in any court” occurring in
Section 195(1)(c) of the old Code is to afford
protection to witnesses also, the interpretation placed
on the said provision in the earlier decisions would
still hold good. 33."
27,"and 340, CrPC. The Court reiterated the test laid down in
Sachida Nand Singh, i.e., that the offence in respect of which
only the Court can make a complaint must be one which has a
direct correlation to, or a direct impact on, proceedings before a
court of justice. It is for this reason that only the relevant Court
is vested with the right to consider the desirability of complaining
against the guilty party. The Court further noted that the situation wherein the
offence as enumerated under Section 195(1)(b)(ii) has been
committed earlier, but the document is produced later in court is
not in consonance with the object of Sections 195(1)(b)(i) either."
28,"CrPC respectively. This Court in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai had
noted that even under Section 192(b) of the 1898 Code
(corresponding to Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC), the offence
committed is one with a “close nexus” to the court proceedings. II. Import of the Words “ in relation to ” in Section 195(1)(b)
(i), CrPC."
29,"accounts in civil court proceedings between the parties. They had
initially filed application under Section 340, CrPC before the
relevant Judicial Magistrate. However, they later sought to
convert this into private complaints, in reliance upon Iqbal
Singh Marwah (supra). The respondents objected on the ground
that the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(i) could not be circumvented."
30,"193, IPC and the offence of forgery. It noted that the averments
made by the appellants in their complaints pertained exclusively
to giving of false evidence and did not disclose the ingredients of
forgery as defined under the IPC. Hence, this Court in Bandekar
Brothers upheld the respondents’ contentions, and opined that
Iqbal Singh Marwah would not benefit the appellants in that
case. Even though the false evidence was created outside of the
Court, it was by the appellants’ own admission, created “in
relation to” proceedings before the Court."
31,"of offences described in Section 463, and punishable
under Sections 471, 475 or 476 of the Indian Penal
Code, when such offences are alleged to have been
committed in respect of a document produced or
given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court. What
is conspicuous by its absence in Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
are the words “or in relation to”, making it clear that
if the provisions of Section 195(1)(b)(ii) are attracted,
then the offence alleged to have been committed must
be committed in respect of a document that is
custodia legis, and not an offence that may have
occurred prior to the document being introduced in
court proceedings. Indeed, it is this distinction that is
vital in understanding the sheet anchor of the
Appellant's case namely, this Court's judgment in
Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra).”
(emphasis supplied)
10.2 We fully agree with the aforementioned reasoning. The
presence of “in relation to” under Section 195(1)(b)(i) means that
Iqbal Singh Marwah would not have blanket application to
every case where a complaint is lodged in respect of an offence
specified under that Section."
32,"erroneous opinion on a point material to the result of the
proceedings. Hence it could be said that though the offence was
not committed during the course of the court proceedings, it was
certainly committed “in relation to” such proceedings. 11. Similar circumstances were present in Kailash Mangal v.
Ramesh Chand (Dead) Through Legal Representative, (2015)
15 SCC 729 and Narendra Kumar Srivastava v. State of
Bihar and Others, (2019) 3 SCC 318, which were the decisions
relied upon by this Court in Bandekar Brothers (supra)."
33,"(emphasis supplied) Therefore, this Court expressly observed in Kailash
Mangal that since the document was filed during the course of a
proceeding which was already pending before the court, the
offence could be said to have been committed “in relation to” such
proceeding for the purpose of Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC. The
requirement of reasonable nexus between the offence and the
proceeding before the Court was clearly satisfied in that case. 11.1"
34,"persuaded to form an opinion based on certain false evidence
which was produced by persons who were already party to the
proceedings. This is a completely different factual matrix from the
present case. 12. Indeed, at this juncture it must be noted that even
Sachida Nand Singh (supra) and Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra)
were rendered in the context of balancing the right of private
parties to initiate complaints in respect of forged documents, with
protecting parties to civil suits from frivolous or vexatious
prosecutions."
35,"who is not yet party to proceedings before the
Trial Court, is an offence committed “in relation
to” such proceedings for the purpose of the bar
under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
14. The construction of the words “in relation to” must be
controlled by the overarching principle applicable to Section
195(1)(b), CrPC as stated in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai (supra)
and Sachida Nand Singh (supra), which was affirmed by the
Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra). That is,
even if the offence is committed prior to giving of the fabricated
evidence in court, it must have a direct or reasonably close nexus
with the court proceedings. 15."
36,"also apply where a person who is initially not a party to the court
proceedings fabricates certain evidence, and
1) subsequently becomes a party and produces it before the
Court; or;
2) falsely deposes as a witness before the Court on the strength of
such evidence,
for the purpose of causing the Court to form an erroneous
opinion on a point material to the result of the proceedings. 16. However, where a person fabricates false evidence for the
purpose of misleading the investigating officer, this may not have
any direct nexus with the subsequent court proceedings. There is
an indirect nexus inasmuch as if the investigating agency does
not suspect any wrongdoing, and the Court commits the case for
trial, the evidence will be produced for the Court’s perusal and
impact the judicial decision­making process."
37,"light that the evidence was falsely adduced, it will be the
investigating agency which will suffer loss of face and be forced to
conduct a fresh investigation. Hence, though the offence is one
which affects the administration of justice, it is the investigating
agency, and not the Court, which is the aggrieved party in such
circumstance.
17. In this regard, we consider it beneficial to refer to the
portion of the opinion expressed by the Constitution Bench in
Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra) as to why a narrow interpretation
of Section 195(1)(b)(ii), CrPC was necessary to avoid
impracticality or injustice in its implementation:
“23…Before filing of the complaint, the court may
hold a preliminary enquiry and record a finding to the
effect that it is expedient in the interests of justice
that enquiry should be made into any of the offences
referred to in Section 195(1)(b). This expediency will
normally be judged by the court by weighing not the
magnitude of injury suffered by the person affected
by such forgery or forged document, but having
regard to the effect or impact, such commission of
offence has upon administration of justice."
38,"administration of justice may be minimal. In such
circumstances, the court may not consider it
expedient in the interest of justice to make a
complaint. The broad view of clause (b)(ii), as
canvassed by learned counsel for the appellants,
would render the victim of such forgery or forged
document remediless. Any interpretation which leads
to a situation where a victim of a crime is rendered
remediless, has to be discarded."
39,"the broad interpretation sought to be placed upon
clause (b)(ii). xxx
26. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that the
courts are normally reluctant to direct filing of a
criminal complaint and such a course is rarely
adopted. It will not be fair and proper to give an
interpretation which leads to a situation where a
person alleged to have committed an offence of the
type enumerated in clause (b)(ii) is either not placed
for trial on account of non­filing of a complaint or if a
complaint is filed, the same does not come to its
logical end."
40,"Constitution Bench should not be disregarded. This is especially
given that the Court did not consider Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
separately but provided a holistic view of the scheme under
Section 195(1)(b). 17.1 Just like a private party who has been a victim of
forgery committed outside the precincts of the Court, the
investigative agency should not be left remediless against persons
who have producing false evidence for the purpose of interfering
with the investigation process."
41,"falsified. Second, the investigative agency at that very stage
suspects that the material produced before them is bogus or
forged in nature. In both scenarios, the Court has not had an
opportunity to consider the allegedly fabricated evidence, as trial
has not yet commenced in respect of the offence. Hence it would
not be possible for the Court to independently ascertain the need
for lodging a complaint under Section 195(1)(b)(i) read with
Section 340, CrPC when the evidence alleged to have been
falsified is not even present on its records."
42,"compelled to take a chance and wait for the trial court to form its
opinion in each and every case. This may give the offender under
Section 193, IPC sufficient time to fabricate more falsehoods to
hide the original crime. Further, irrespective of the potential
impact that such false evidence may have on the opinion formed
by the trial court, the investigating agency has a separate right to
proceed against the accused for attempting to obstruct fair and
transparent probe into a criminal offence. Thus, we are of the
view that it would be impracticable to insist upon lodging of
written complaint by the Court under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC
in such a situation."
43,"may take judicial notice of such defect in the investigation
process and make a complaint under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC. Since by this stage, the evidence has been produced before the
Court, and contains potential for directly impacting the formation
of the Court’s opinion on the innocence or guilt of the accused
person, invoking the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(i) may not give
rise to much difficulty. However, at this juncture, we decline to
make any conclusive finding on this aspect, as the facts of the
present appeal do not require us to consider the same. It is left
open to future Benches of this Court to settle this issue if it so
arises before them."
44,"Haryana Bar Association, directed the CBI to conduct an
independent investigation [Punjab and Haryana High Court
Bar Association, Chandigarh Through its Secretary v. State
of Punjab and Others, (1994) 1 SCC 616]. Subsequently, after
the CBI submitted its report, it was directed to file the necessary
challan before the trial court [Punjab & Haryana High Court
Bar Association v. State of Punjab and Others, (1996) 4 SCC
742)]. The CBI then filed a chargesheet before the designated trial
court in that case under Sections 193 and 211, IPC."
45,"referring to the observations made in that case. Hence the
decision in Arvindervir Singh will not have any application to
the case at hand as it involved a completely different set of
factual and legal issues. III. Whether “ stage of a judicial proceeding ” under
Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC is synonymous with
“ proceeding in any court ” under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
20."
46,"20.1 The purpose of Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC is
evidently to ensure that a person who fabricates false evidence
before an investigating or inquiring authority prior to the trial of
the case does not escape penalty. This encompasses all nature of
proceedings, whether civil or criminal. However, whether the
commission of such offence would require the complaint of a
Court under Section 195(1)(b)(i) would depend upon the authority
before whom such false evidence is given."
47,"in respect of certain offences to public servants, or to the relevant
Court, as they are considered to be the only party who is directly
aggrieved or impacted by those offences. Furthermore, for the
purpose of Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC, there must be an intention
on part of the alleged offender to directly mislead the Court into
forming a certain opinion by commission of offence under Section
193, IPC. Though a criminal investigation is certainly a stage of a
judicial proceeding insofar as it may culminate in issue of
process and trial against the accused, it would not be a
proceeding in relation to a certain Court under Section 195(1)(b)
(i), CrPC before the Court has even taken judicial notice of such
investigation. The difference between a “stage” of a judicial
proceeding and the judicial proceeding itself must be emphasized
in this regard."
48,"Tax Officer under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 would be
proceedings in any court under Section 195(1)(b) of the 1898
Code, which was the corresponding section in that Code to
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC. Section 37(4) of the 1922 Act provided
that proceedings before the Income Tax authority shall be
deemed to be “judicial proceedings” (and not merely a stage of
such proceedings) under Section 193, IPC. It was in this context
that the majority of the Constitution Bench (K.C. Dasgupta J.,
dissenting) held that the expressions “judicial proceeding” under
the 1922 Act and “proceeding in any court” under Section 195(1)
(b), 1898 Code are synonymous. Therefore, a private complaint
would not be maintainable in respect of a false statement given
on oath before the Income Tax Officer."
49,"the competent appellate authority authorized to make a
complaint under Section 195(4), CrPC. However, the Division
Bench, referring to Lalji Haridas, made an ancillary observation
that such search operation is deemed to be a “judicial
proceeding” under Section 193, CrPC, and that the relevant
Income Tax authority would be deemed to be a civil court for the
purpose of Section 195, CrPC. This is as per the express
provision made to the effect under Section 196 of the 1961 Act. 21.2 In Chandrapal Singh and Others v. Maharaj Singh
and Another, (1982)"
50,"1898 Code. Moreover, that proceedings before such authority
shall be judicial proceedings under Section 193, IPC. The three­Judge Bench noted that under the 1972 Act, the
Rent Control Officer was authorized to exercise the powers and
functions of the District Magistrate. Hence, in view of the specific
provision made under Section 34(2) of the 1972 Act, the Rent
Control Officer would also be deemed to be a civil court and the
proceedings before him would be judicial proceedings."
51,"proceedings”, the same would be considered as “proceedings in
any court” under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC. Therefore, if the
offence under Section 193, IPC is committed before such an
authority, the written complaint of that authority is mandatorily
required for trial of the offence. However, the facts of the
decisions in Lalji Haridas (supra), Babita Lila (supra) and
Chandrapal Singh (supra), are clearly distinguishable from the
present appeal as they all involve 1) False statements made on
oath or in affidavits, 2) in a judicial proceeding and 3) before an
authority which is expressly deemed under law to be a “court”. None of the aforequoted cases were concerned with fabrication of
evidence before an investigating authority under a penal statute."
52,"be paid back to Accused No. 2. They additionally produced a false
sale deed dated 24.01.2001 and certain books of account in
support of their claim. There was no involvement of the Trial
Court at this stage in as much as the letter dated 4.02.2002 and
the sale deed were obviously intended to convince the
investigation agency that the Appellant had not accumulated
disproportionate financial assets. Had the Respondent accepted
the veracity of the contents of this letter, they would not only
have dropped the investigation against Appellant/Accused No. 1
but also wrongfully returned the seized currency under the
mistaken impression that it was the property of Accused No. 2."
53,"goal was to ensure that the Appellant/Accused No. 1 was cleared
of wrongdoing at the stage of investigation itself. It was after
being charged under Section 193, IPC, that the
Appellants/accused reiterated the fictitious escrow arrangement
story before the Trial Court so as to prove their innocence. Hence
it cannot be said that the offence under Sections 120B read with
193, IPC was committed by the Appellants “in relation to” a
proceeding in a court under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC. 22.2 Section 2(i), CrPC defines “judicial proceeding” as
including any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or
may be legally taken by oath."
54,"equated with a proceeding in a court of law under Section 195(1)
(b)(i), CrPC, though it is deemed to be a stage of a judicial
proceeding under Section 193, IPC. 22.3 Had this been a case wherein the Respondent had not
developed any suspicion against Accused Nos. 2 and 3, and the
Trial Court had subsequently discovered the subterfuge caused
by them, we may have taken a different view. As we have noted in
paragraph 18 (supra), where the fabrication of evidence has
escaped the scrutiny of the investigating agency, and the case is
subsequently brought to trial, such evidence would have direct
bearing on the trial court’s opinion and hence the bar under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC may be applicable. However, in the
present case, the investigating agency has been sagacious
enough to detect the commission of offence under Section 193,
IPC at the preliminary stage."
55,"we do not find any valid reason to interfere with the concurrent
findings of the Trial Court and the High Court. The High Court
has rightly observed that the Appellant/Accused No. 1 had not
raised the defence of holding the money in escrow for Accused
Nos. 2 and 3 at the time of search conducted at his house on
24.01.2001. The supposed agreement of sale was also not
produced."
56,"and delay in completion of the trial. In view of the gravity of the
offence, no further benefit can be granted to them in this regard. Conclusions
24. The questions of law formulated in paragraph 6
(supra) are answered as follows:
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC will not bar
prosecution by the investigating agency for offence
punishable under Section 193, IPC, which is
committed during the stage of investigation."
57,"24.1 The appeals are accordingly dismissed both on law and
on merits. The sentence awarded by the High Court shall be set­
off against the period of imprisonment, if any, already undergone
by the Appellants. The Appellants are directed to surrender
within two weeks for serving out the rest of their sentence, if they
are not already in custody. The Registry is further directed to
expeditiously release the amount of fine, if any, deposited before
this Court."
