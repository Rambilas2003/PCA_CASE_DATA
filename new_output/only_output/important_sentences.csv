47,"Furthermore, for the
purpose of Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC, there must be an intention

47,"Though a criminal investigation is certainly a stage of a
judicial proceeding insofar as it may culminate in issue of
process and trial against the accused, it would not be a
proceeding in relation to a certain Court under Section 195(1)(b)
(i), CrPC before the Court has even taken judicial notice of such
investigation.",4.2341,"investigation, stage, proceeding, issue, process, trial, accused","[('Court', 'ORG'), ('Section 195(1)(b', 'LAW'), ('CrPC', 'ORG'), ('Court', 'ORG')]"

48,"It was in this context
that the majority of the Constitution Bench (K.C. Dasgupta J.,
dissenting) held that the expressions “judicial proceeding” under
the 1922 Act and “proceeding in any court” under Section 195(1)
(b), 1898 Code are synonymous.",4.0335,"context, majority, Constitution, Bench, K.C., Dasgupta, dissenting","[('the Constitution Bench', 'LAW'), ('Section 195(1', 'LAW'), ('1898', 'DATE')]"
48,"In Babita Lila and Another v. Union of India, (2016)
9 SCC 647, a Division Bench of this Court similarly considered
the jurisdiction of the Deputy Director of Income Tax to make a
complaint under Section 195(1)(b), CrPC in respect of false

49,"However, the Division
Bench, referring to Lalji Haridas, made an ancillary observation
that such search operation is deemed to be a “judicial
proceeding” under Section 193, CrPC, and that the relevant
Income Tax authority would be deemed to be a civil court for the
purpose of Section 195, CrPC.",4.5579,"Division, Bench, Lalji, Haridas, observation, search, operation","[('the Division\nBench', 'ORG'), ('Lalji Haridas', 'PERSON'), ('Section 193', 'LAW'), ('CrPC', 'ORG'), ('Income Tax', 'ORG'), ('Section 195', 'LAW'), ('CrPC', 'ORG')]"

Court was faced with the issue of whether 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC
would bar a complaint under Sections 193, 199 and 201 of the
IPC alleging making of false statements in affidavit before the
Rent Control Officer under the U.P, Urban Buildings (Regulation

49,"Similar to the
aforementioned income tax statutes, Section 34(2) of the 1972
Act provided that the District Magistrate or the prescribed
authority holding an inquiry under the Act shall be deemed to be
a Civil Court within the meaning of Sections 480 and 482 of the

50,"Hence, in view of the specific
provision made under Section 34(2) of the 1972 Act, the Rent
Control Officer would also be deemed to be a civil court and the
proceedings before him would be judicial proceedings.",3.7368,"view, provision, Section, Rent, Control, Officer, court","[('Section 34(2', 'LAW'), ('1972', 'DATE'), ('the Rent\nControl Officer', 'ORG')]"
50,"Even otherwise, on the facts of the case, the three­Judge Bench
found that abuse of criminal process had taken place and
observed that “chagrined and frustrated litigants should not be
permitted to give vent to their frustration by cheaply invoking the
jurisdiction of the criminal court” (Chandrapal Singh, (supra),
paragraph 14).",4.8401,"facts, case, three­Judge, Bench, abuse, process, place","[('Bench', 'PRODUCT'), ('Chandrapal Singh', 'PERSON'), ('14', 'CARDINAL')]"
51,"However, the facts of the
decisions in Lalji Haridas (supra), Babita Lila (supra) and
Chandrapal Singh (supra), are clearly distinguishable from the
present appeal as they all involve 1) False statements made on
oath or in affidavits, 2) in a judicial proceeding and 3) before an
authority which is expressly deemed under law to be a “court”.",4.7438,"facts, decisions, Lalji, Haridas, supra, Babita, Lila","[('Lalji Haridas', 'PERSON'), ('Babita Lila', 'PERSON'), ('Chandrapal Singh', 'PERSON'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL')]"
51,"In the present case, pursuant to recovering the seized
currency from the Appellant’s house on 24.01.2001, the
Respondent initiated investigation under Section 13(2) read with
Section 13(1)(e), PC Act against him.",4.1625,"case, currency, Appellant, house, Respondent, investigation, Section","[('Appellant', 'PRODUCT'), ('24.01.2001', 'DATE'), ('Section 13(2', 'LAW')]"
51,"2 and 3, at the
behest of the Appellant, wrote letter dated 4.02.2002 to the

was held by the Appellant as part of an escrow arrangement
amongst the parties.",4.0896,"behest, Appellant, letter, Superintendent, Police, currency, escrow","[('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('Appellant', 'PRODUCT'), ('CBI', 'ORG'), ('Appellant', 'PRODUCT')]"
52,"There was no involvement of the Trial
Court at this stage in as much as the letter dated 4.02.2002 and
the sale deed were obviously intended to convince the
investigation agency that the Appellant had not accumulated
disproportionate financial assets.",4.3379,"involvement, Trial, Court, stage, letter, sale, deed","[('the Trial\nCourt', 'ORG'), ('Appellant', 'ORG')]"
52,"Had the Respondent accepted
the veracity of the contents of this letter, they would not only
have dropped the investigation against Appellant/Accused No. 1

mistaken impression that it was the property of Accused No. 2.",3.934,"Respondent, veracity, contents, letter, investigation, Appellant, currency","[('Appellant/Accused No', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('2', 'CARDINAL')]"
53,"Hence
it cannot be said that the offence under Sections 120B read with
193, IPC was committed by the Appellants “in relation to” a
proceeding in a court under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC.",3.7341,"offence, Sections, 120B, Appellants, relation, proceeding, court","[('193', 'CARDINAL'), ('IPC', 'ORG'), ('Section 195(1)(b)(i', 'LAW'), ('CrPC', 'ORG')]"

fabricated evidence in the present case given on oath before the
investigating officer, nor is the investigating authority under the
PC Act deemed to be a “court” for the purpose of Section 195(1)
(b), CrPC.",3.8642,"evidence, case, oath, officer, authority, court, purpose","[('Section 195(1', 'LAW'), ('CrPC', 'ORG')]"
54,"22.3 Had this been a case wherein the Respondent had not
developed any suspicion against Accused Nos. 2 and 3, and the
Trial Court had subsequently discovered the subterfuge caused
by them, we may have taken a different view.",3.8293,"case, Respondent, suspicion, Accused, Trial, Court, subterfuge","[('22.3', 'CARDINAL'), ('Accused Nos', 'PERSON'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('Trial Court', 'ORG')]"
54,"As we have noted in
paragraph 18 (supra), where the fabrication of evidence has
escaped the scrutiny of the investigating agency, and the case is
subsequently brought to trial, such evidence would have direct
bearing on the trial court’s opinion and hence the bar under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC may be applicable.",4.5888,"paragraph, supra, fabrication, evidence, scrutiny, agency, case","[('18', 'DATE'), ('Section 195(1)(b)(i', 'LAW'), ('CrPC', 'ORG')]"
54,"Therefore, as stated by us in
paragraph 17.3 (supra), it would be unjust and impracticable to
insist upon the requirement of an independent inquiry and
written complaint by the Trial Court in such a scenario.

55,"It is
improbable in the ordinary course of conduct that a person
would wait so long to claim an amount of approximately Rs. 80
lakhs which was required for completion of sale transaction.",3.9645,"course, conduct, person, lakhs, completion, sale, transaction","[('80', 'CARDINAL')]"

entered into an elaborate conspiracy and attempted to create a
false circumstance of escrow transaction for the purpose of
shielding Appellant/Accused No. 1 from prosecution.",3.9214,"Appellants, conspiracy, circumstance, transaction, purpose, shielding, Appellant","[('Appellants', 'ORG'), ('Appellant/Accused No', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1', 'CARDINAL')]"
