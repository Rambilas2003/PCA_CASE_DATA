2,"These appeals arise out of judgment dated 6.01.2020 in
Crl. A. Nos.",2,"1089, 1090 and 1091 of 2007 passed by the High
Court of Judicature at Madras (“High Court”)."
2,"The Appellant/Accused No. 1 was working as Regional
Manager (South) at Chennai with the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.
On 4.01.2001 case was registered against the Appellant under
Section 120B read with Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”); and Section 13(2) read with
Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (“PC
Act”).",2,"Subsequently, the officers of the Respondent investigative
agency conducted search at the Appellant’s residence on
24.01.2001 on the basis of search warrant issued by the Special
Judge, Tis Hazari Court, New Delhi."
2,"Since these assets were found to be
disproportionate to the Appellant’s known sources of income, on
2",3,"9.03.2001 a separate disproportionate assets case was registered
against him under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the PC Act."
4,"However, pertinently, the
Appellant had not taken any such defence at the time of search
conducted in his house on 24.01.2001, nor had he produced the
duplicate sale deed before the officers of the Respondent agency
at that time.",4,"3.3 Investigation conducted by the Respondent revealed
that the market value fixed by the State Government in respect of
the two properties described in sale deed dated 24.01.2001, was
much below Rs 80 lakhs."
5,"Therefore, the
Respondent’s claim is that the Appellant conspired with Accused
Nos.",5,"2­4 to fabricate false deed of agreement for sale for the
purpose of being shielded from legal action in the
disproportionate assets case."
5,"Accordingly, the Learned Additional
Special Judge for CBI Cases, Chennai (“Trial Court”) framed
charges against the Appellant and Accused Nos.",5,"2­4 under
Section 120B read with Section 193 of the IPC, in addition to
charges under the PC Act already framed against the Appellant."
5,"No objection was raised by the accused at the stage of
taking of cognizance.",5,"However, during the course of trial, the
Accused argued that complaint under Section 195(1)(b) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) was necessary for
prosecuting the case under Section 193, IPC."
6,"Furthermore, based on the evidence on the record, the Trial
Court found that it was not proved that Accused No. 2 had
entrusted the seized currency to the Appellant for holding in
escrow till completion of sale transaction by Accused No. 3.",6,"Hence, the Trial Court convicted the Appellant under Section
13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act; as well as Sections
120B and 193 of the IPC, and sentenced him to rigorous
imprisonment for two years and payment of fine of Rs 1.5 lakhs."
6,"2 and 3
reiterated that the requirements of Sections 195(1)(b)(i) and 340
of the CrPC were not complied with prior to framing of charge
under Section 193, IPC.",6,"Therefore, framing of charge without
conduct of inquiry and making of written complaint by the Trial
Court was illegal and without jurisdiction."
7,"The High Court relied upon the decision of a three­Judge
Bench of this Court in Sachida Nand Singh and Another v.
State of Bihar and Another, (1998) 2 SCC 493, and the later
Constitution Bench decision in Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra)
which affirmed the view taken in Sachida Nand Singh, while
laying down its opinion.",7,"Though these decisions were rendered in
the context of interpreting Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the CrPC, the
High Court held that Section 195(1)(b)(i) is analogous to the
former provision."
7,"On merits, the High Court confirmed the Trial Court’s
finding that the Accused had conspired to fabricate false evidence
for shielding Appellant/Accused No. 1 from prosecution in the
7",8,disproportionate assets case.
8,"They have relied upon Bandekar Brothers
Pvt. Ltd. and Another v. Prasad Vassudev Keni and Others,
AIR 2020 SC 4247 in support of their contentions.",8,"Thus, they
have stressed that there is an absolute bar against taking of
cognizance for the offences specified under Section 195(1)(b)(i),
CrPC by any means except upon written complaint by the
concerned Court."
9,"(1) No Court shall take cognizance—
(b)(i) of any offence punishable under any of the
following sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
1860), namely, sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive),
199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when
9",10,"such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or
in relation to, any proceeding in any Court,
or
(ii) of any offence described in section 463, or
punishable under section 471, section 475 or section
476, of the said Code, when such offence is alleged to
have been committed in respect of a document
produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any
Court,
or
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit, or attempt
to commit, or the abetment of, any offence specified
in sub­clause (i) or sub­clause (ii),
except on the complaint in writing of that Court or by
such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise
in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to
which that Court is subordinate."
11,"Whereas Section 195(1)(b)(i) applies to offences
against public justice which are committed not only in any
proceeding in any court, but also “in relation to” such proceeding.",11,"Whether such semantical difference bars the analogous
application of precedents relating to Section 195(1)(b)(ii) for
interpreting Section 195(1)(b)(i) will be discussed by us later."
12,"When upon an application made to it in
this behalf or otherwise any Court is of opinion that it
is expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry
should be made into any offence referred to in clause
(b) of Sub­Section (1) of section 195, which appears to
have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding
in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a
document produced or given in evidence in a
proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such
preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks necessary;
(a) record a finding to that effect;
(b) make a complaint thereof in writing;
(c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having
jurisdiction;
(d) take sufficient security for the appearance for the
accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged
offence is non­bailable and the Court thinks it
necessary so to do send the accused in custody to
such Magistrate; and
(e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence
before such Magistrate.",12,"In this section, “Court” has the same meaning as
in section 195.”"
12,"At this juncture, it is relevant to note that a Bench of this
Court (consisting of one of us) in State of Punjab v. Jasbir
Singh, (2020) 12 SCC 96, has referred the question of whether it
is mandatory for the Court to conduct a preliminary inquiry and
provide opportunity of hearing to the would­be­accused under
12",13,"Section 340, CrPC prior to making a complaint under Section
195, for consideration of a larger Bench."
14,"Had the
genuineness of the sale deed been accepted, the Respondent may
have erroneously opined that the seized currency belonged to
Accused No. 2, and consequently abandoned proceedings under
Section 13(1)(e), PC Act against the Appellant.",14,"Therefore Section
193, IPC is squarely applicable to the allegations at hand."
15,"Whether an offence under Section 193, IPC
committed at the stage of investigation, prior to
production of the false evidence before the Trial
Court by a person who is not yet party to
proceedings before the Trial Court, is an offence
“in relation to” a proceeding in any court under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
6.2 Whether the words “stage of a judicial proceeding”
under Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC can be
equated with “proceeding in any court” under
Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
15",16,"I. General overview of the law on Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
7."
16,"The issue of whether Section 195(1)(b)
(ii), CrPC is applicable to documents which are forged prior to
their production in Court is no longer res integra.",16,"This Court in
Sachida Nand Singh (supra) has held that Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
read with Section 340(1), CrPC will only apply in respect of
offences which are committed during the time when the
document concerned was custodia legis or in the custody of the
Court."
16,"The contention of the appellants is that if the
offence alleged is with respect to a document which
reached the Court then the aforesaid bar operates, no
matter whether the offence was committed before or
after its production in court.",16,"In other words,
according to the appellants, the decisive event for
attracting the bar is the production of the document
in the Court."
17,"Section 190 of the Code
empowers “any magistrate of the first class” to take
cognizance of “any offence” upon receiving a
complaint, or police report or information or upon his
own knowledge.",17,"Section 195 restricts such general
powers of the magistrate, and the general right of a
person to move the court with a complaint is to that
extent curtailed."
17,"It is a well­recognised canon of
interpretation that provision curbing the general
jurisdiction of the court must normally receive strict
interpretation unless the statute or the context
requires otherwise (Abdul Waheed Khan v. Bhawani",17,[AIR 1966 SC 1718: (1966) 3 SCR 617]).
19,"The ratio of the decision
therein is the following: (SCC Headnote)",19,"“The offences about which the court alone is clothed
with the right to complain may, therefore, be
appropriately considered to be only those offences
committed by a party to a proceeding in that court,
the commission of which has a reasonably close
nexus with the proceedings in that court so that it
can without embarking upon a completely
independent and fresh inquiry, satisfactorily consider
by reference principally to its records the expediency
of prosecuting the delinquent party."
19,"After stating so their Lordships proceeded to
observe that the legislature could not have intended
to extend the prohibition in the sub­section to
offences committed by a party to the proceedings
prior to his becoming such a party.",19,"According to their
Lordships, any construction to the contrary would
unreasonably restrict the right of a person which was
recognized in Section 190 of the Code.”
(emphasis supplied)
Aforementioned observations of this Court in Patel
Laljibhai Somabhai (supra), as cited in Sachida Nand Singh
(supra), make the import and purpose of Section 195(1)(b), CrPC
19"
20,"The same would not have a “reasonably close nexus” with the
court proceedings.",21,"Though these observations in Sachida Nand Singh were
made in the context of Section 195(1)(b)(ii), we find that they have
useful application in interpreting Section 195(1)(b)(i) as well."
21,"The
prohibition contained in Section 195(1)(b)(i) should not be
extended to provide protection to a person who has been accused
of tendering false evidence during the investigative stage prior to
becoming a party to the court proceedings and producing such
evidence before the Court.",21,"The view taken in Sachida Nand Singh was
subsequently affirmed by the Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh
Marwah (supra)."
21,"Since the respondents’
application under Section 340, CrPC was not disposed of, they
filed a criminal complaint for prosecuting the appellants under
Sections 192 and 193, as well as Sections 463 and 471, IPC.",21,"The
Metropolitan Magistrate in that case held that both Sections
195(1)(b)(i) and (ii), CrPC operated as a bar against taking
cognizance of these offences."
22,"However, it was noticed that Sachida Nand Singh appeared to
conflict with an earlier three­Judge Bench decision in Surjit
Singh and Others v. Balbir Singh, (1996) 3 SCC 533.",22,"Surjit
Singh had held that the bar against taking cognizance under
Section 195(1)(b)(ii) would apply even if the offences stipulated
therein were committed prior to production of the document
before the Court, if such document was subsequently produced
before the Court."
22,"The
situation or contingency where an offence as
enumerated in this clause has already been
committed earlier and later on the document is
produced or is given in evidence in court, does not
appear to be in tune with clauses (a)(i) and (b)(i) and
22",23,consequently with the scheme of Section 195 CrPC.
24,"in considerable detail observed that as a general rule
the courts consider it expedient in the interest of
justice to start prosecutions as contemplated by
Section 476 (of the old Code which now corresponds
to Section 340 CrPC) only if there is a reasonable
foundation for the charge and there is a reasonable
likelihood of conviction.",24,"The requirement of a finding
as to the expediency is understandable in case of an
offence alleged to have been committed either in or in
relation to a proceeding in that court in case of
offences specified in clause (b)"
25,"The observations therein should not
be understood as laying down anything contrary to
what has been held in Patel Laljibhai but was made
in the context that bar contained in Section 195(1)(b)
(ii) would not be attracted unless the original
document was filed.",25,"It is for this reason that in the
very next paragraph, after observing that the
cognizance had been taken prior to filing of the civil
suit and the original agreement in court, the view
taken by the High Court that the Magistrate could
25"
26,"Curiously, though the facts of Iqbal Singh Marwah also
required a determination as to the applicability of Section 195(1)
(b)(i), the Constitution Bench did not express any specific finding
on this point.",26,"This was perhaps because the limited point for
consideration before the Bench was the apparent conflict between
Sachida Nand Singh and Surjit Singh (supra)."
27,"Even in Surjit Singh, this Court had held on the facts of that
case, that since the criminal Court had taken cognizance of the
offence long before filing of the original document before the civil
Court, the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(ii) would not apply.",27,"Similar to Sachida Nand Singh, the Constitution Bench
also referred to the observations made by the three­Judge Bench
in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai (supra) on Sections 192(b) and
192(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (“1898 Code”)
which corresponded to Section 192(1)(b)(i) and (ii) of the present
27"
28,"This Court in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai had
noted that even under Section 192(b) of the 1898 Code
(corresponding to Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC), the offence
committed is one with a “close nexus” to the court proceedings.",28,"Import of the Words “ in relation to ” in Section 195(1)(b)
(i), CrPC."
28,"Therefore,
it may not be possible to apply the ratio of Iqbal Singh Marwah
by way of analogy to Section 195(1)(b)(i) in every case.",28,"For further elucidation on this point, we may turn to the
recent decision of this Court in Bandekar Brothers (supra)."
28,"The
appellants in that case claimed that the respondents/accused
had given false evidence and forged debit notes and books of
28",29,accounts in civil court proceedings between the parties.
29,"The respondents objected on the ground
that the bar under Section 195(1)(b)(i) could not be circumvented.",29,"Subsequently, the appellants took the plea that offences under
Section 195(1)(b)(ii) were also made out:
“13."
29,"The point forcefully argued by the learned
Counsel on behalf of the Appellants is that his
clients, being victims of forgery, ought not to be
rendered remediless in respect of the acts of forgery
which are committed before they are used as evidence
in a court proceeding, and that therefore, a private
complaint would be maintainable in the fact
circumstance mentioned in the two criminal
complaints referred to hereinabove.",29,"The Court has
thus to steer between two opposite poles of a
spectrum the “yin” being the protection of a person
from frivolous criminal complaints, and the “yang”
being the right of a victim to ventilate his grievance
and have the Court try the offence of forgery by
means of a private complaint."
30,"Hence, this Court in Bandekar
Brothers upheld the respondents’ contentions, and opined that
Iqbal Singh Marwah would not benefit the appellants in that
case.",30,"Even though the false evidence was created outside of the
Court, it was by the appellants’ own admission, created “in
relation to” proceedings before the Court."
31,"What
is conspicuous by its absence in Section 195(1)(b)(ii)
are the words “or in relation to”, making it clear that
if the provisions of Section 195(1)(b)(ii) are attracted,
then the offence alleged to have been committed must
be committed in respect of a document that is
custodia legis, and not an offence that may have
occurred prior to the document being introduced in
court proceedings.",31,"Indeed, it is this distinction that is
vital in understanding the sheet anchor of the
Appellant's case namely, this Court's judgment in
Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra).”
(emphasis supplied)
10.2 We fully agree with the aforementioned reasoning."
31,"However, on the facts of Bandekar
Brothers, this was not a situation in which the offence
complained of did not have a “reasonably close nexus” with the
court proceedings.",31,"The offence of giving false evidence was
committed by the respondents, who were party to the court
proceedings, for the purpose of leading the Court to form an
31"
32,"Since the
offence is said to have been committed in relation to
or in a proceeding in a civil court, the case of Iqbal
Singh Marwah is not applicable to the instant case.”
32",33,(emphasis supplied)
34,"Indeed, at this juncture it must be noted that even
Sachida Nand Singh (supra) and Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra)
were rendered in the context of balancing the right of private
parties to initiate complaints in respect of forged documents, with
protecting parties to civil suits from frivolous or vexatious
prosecutions.",34,"In neither of the abovementioned decisions has this
Court authoritatively considered the specific issue of preserving
the right of an investigative agency, such as the Respondent in
the present case, to initiate complaints against persons who have
fabricated false evidence during the course of criminal
proceedings.
13."
36,"There is
an indirect nexus inasmuch as if the investigating agency does
not suspect any wrongdoing, and the Court commits the case for
trial, the evidence will be produced for the Court’s perusal and
impact the judicial decision­making process.",36,"However, it may be
equally possible that even if the fabricated evidence appears
sufficiently convincing, the investigating agency may drop
proceedings against the accused and divert its time and
resources elsewhere."
36,"Therefore, the offence may never reach the
stage of court proceedings.",36,"Further, if it subsequently comes to
36"
37,"Hence, though the offence is one
which affects the administration of justice, it is the investigating
agency, and not the Court, which is the aggrieved party in such
circumstance.
17.",37,"In this regard, we consider it beneficial to refer to the
portion of the opinion expressed by the Constitution Bench in
Iqbal Singh Marwah (supra) as to why a narrow interpretation
of Section 195(1)(b)(ii), CrPC was necessary to avoid
impracticality or injustice in its implementation:
“23…Before filing of the complaint, the court may
hold a preliminary enquiry and record a finding to the
effect that it is expedient in the interests of justice
that enquiry should be made into any of the offences
referred to in Section 195(1)(b)."
37,"It is
possible that such forged document or forgery may
cause a very serious or substantial injury to a person
in the sense that it may deprive him of a very
valuable property or status or the like, but such
document may be just a piece of evidence produced
or given in evidence in court, where voluminous
evidence may have been adduced and the effect of
such piece of evidence on the broad concept of
37",38,administration of justice may be minimal.
38,"In such
circumstances, the court may not consider it
expedient in the interest of justice to make a
complaint.",38,"The broad view of clause (b)(ii), as
canvassed by learned counsel for the appellants,
would render the victim of such forgery or forged
document remediless."
38,"Normally, a direction for filing of a complaint is not
made during the pendency of the proceeding before
the court and this is done at the stage when the
proceeding is concluded and the final judgment is
rendered.",38,"Section 341 provides for an appeal against
an order directing filing of the complaint."
38,"These provisions show that, in
reality, the procedure prescribed for filing a complaint
by the court is such that it may not fructify in the
actual trial of the offender for an unusually long
period.",38,"Delay in prosecution of a guilty person comes
to his advantage as witnesses become reluctant to
give evidence and the evidence gets lost."
39,"It will not be fair and proper to give an
interpretation which leads to a situation where a
person alleged to have committed an offence of the
type enumerated in clause (b)(ii) is either not placed
for trial on account of non­filing of a complaint or if a
complaint is filed, the same does not come to its
logical end.",39,"Judging from such an angle will be in
consonance with the principle that an unworkable or
impracticable result should be avoided…”
(emphasis supplied)"
39,"Therefore, the aforementioned reasons assigned by the
Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh Marwah for adopting a
narrow construction of Section 195(1)(b)(ii), CrPC may not be
strictly applicable in the present case.",39,"However, the general
principles of statutory interpretation laid down by the
39"
40,"Just like a private party who has been a victim of
forgery committed outside the precincts of the Court, the
investigative agency should not be left remediless against persons
who have producing false evidence for the purpose of interfering
with the investigation process.",40,"Moreover, the present case
concerns offences alleged to have been committed under the PC
Act."
40,"Subsequently, it is brought to their notice that the evidence was
40",41,"Second, the investigative agency at that very stage
suspects that the material produced before them is bogus or
forged in nature."
41,"Hence it would
not be possible for the Court to independently ascertain the need
for lodging a complaint under Section 195(1)(b)(i) read with
Section 340, CrPC when the evidence alleged to have been
falsified is not even present on its records.",41,"Rather, it is the
investigating agency which is best placed to verify and prove
whether such falsification has taken place, through what means
and for what purpose."
41,"The investigation agency cannot be
41",42,"compelled to take a chance and wait for the trial court to form its
opinion in each and every case."
42,"The same may not apply for
example, where the investigation agency on the basis of false
evidence given by a third party happens to wrongfully implicate a
person, other than the real perpetrator, for a particular offence.",42,"Subsequently, the Court during the course of trial proceedings
42"
43,"However, at this juncture, we decline to
make any conclusive finding on this aspect, as the facts of the
present appeal do not require us to consider the same.",43,"It is left
open to future Benches of this Court to settle this issue if it so
arises before them."
43,"In that case it was alleged that the investigating
officers themselves (including the appellant therein) had
abducted and murdered an advocate and his family, and falsely
implicated another person for this offence.",43,"The case involving the
falsely accused person had already been committed for trial when
this Court, in writ proceedings initiated by the Punjab and
43"
45,"Whether “ stage of a judicial proceeding ” under
Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC is synonymous with
“ proceeding in any court ” under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC?
20.",45,"The last point that remains to be considered is the effect
of Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC which deems an
investigation preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of
Justice to be a “stage of a judicial proceeding” for the purposes of
the Section."
46,"The purpose of Explanation 2 to Section 193, IPC is
evidently to ensure that a person who fabricates false evidence
before an investigating or inquiring authority prior to the trial of
the case does not escape penalty.",46,"This encompasses all nature of
proceedings, whether civil or criminal."
46,"However, this would not be the case where false evidence is led
before an investigating officer prior to the Court having taken
cognizance of the offence or the case being committed for trial.",46,"20.2 The object and purpose of Section 195(1)(b), CrPC must
be borne in mind whilst determining whether the fabrication of
false evidence during a stage of a judicial proceeding amounts to
having made such fabrication in relation to a proceeding before
the Court."
47,"Though a criminal investigation is certainly a stage of a
judicial proceeding insofar as it may culminate in issue of
process and trial against the accused, it would not be a
proceeding in relation to a certain Court under Section 195(1)(b)
(i), CrPC before the Court has even taken judicial notice of such
investigation.",47,"The difference between a “stage” of a judicial
proceeding and the judicial proceeding itself must be emphasized
in this regard."
48,"In Babita Lila and Another v. Union of India, (2016)
9 SCC 647, a Division Bench of this Court similarly considered
the jurisdiction of the Deputy Director of Income Tax to make a
complaint under Section 195(1)(b), CrPC in respect of false
statements given on oath during a search operation conducted
under the Income Tax Act, 1961.",48,"The discussion in this case was
primarily concerned with whether the Deputy Director would be
48"
49,"21.2 In Chandrapal Singh and Others v. Maharaj Singh
and Another, (1982)",49,"1 SCC 466, a three­Judge Bench of this
Court was faced with the issue of whether 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC
would bar a complaint under Sections 193, 199 and 201 of the
IPC alleging making of false statements in affidavit before the
Rent Control Officer under the U.P, Urban Buildings (Regulation
of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972."
50,"The three­Judge Bench noted that under the 1972 Act, the
Rent Control Officer was authorized to exercise the powers and
functions of the District Magistrate.",50,"Hence, in view of the specific
provision made under Section 34(2) of the 1972 Act, the Rent
Control Officer would also be deemed to be a civil court and the
proceedings before him would be judicial proceedings."
50,"Even otherwise, on the facts of the case, the three­Judge Bench
found that abuse of criminal process had taken place and
observed that “chagrined and frustrated litigants should not be
permitted to give vent to their frustration by cheaply invoking the
jurisdiction of the criminal court” (Chandrapal Singh, (supra),
paragraph 14).",50,"It can be seen from the above discussion that this
Court has, in some instances, opined that where the law deems
proceedings before a certain authority to be “judicial
50"
51,"None of the aforequoted cases were concerned with fabrication of
evidence before an investigating authority under a penal statute.",51,"In the present case, pursuant to recovering the seized
currency from the Appellant’s house on 24.01.2001, the
Respondent initiated investigation under Section 13(2) read with
Section 13(1)(e), PC Act against him."
52,"The Appellants’ intention was not to mislead
the Trial Court, at least not at the first instance.",52,"Rather, their
52"
53,"Hence
it cannot be said that the offence under Sections 120B read with
193, IPC was committed by the Appellants “in relation to” a
proceeding in a court under Section 195(1)(b)(i), CrPC.",53,"22.2 Section 2(i), CrPC defines “judicial proceeding” as
including any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or
may be legally taken by oath."
53,"Thus, it can be concluded that the investigation
conducted by the Respondent under the PC Act cannot be
53",54,"equated with a proceeding in a court of law under Section 195(1)
(b)(i), CrPC, though it is deemed to be a stage of a judicial
proceeding under Section 193, IPC."
54,"However, in the
present case, the investigating agency has been sagacious
enough to detect the commission of offence under Section 193,
IPC at the preliminary stage.",54,"Therefore, as stated by us in
paragraph 17.3 (supra), it would be unjust and impracticable to
insist upon the requirement of an independent inquiry and
written complaint by the Trial Court in such a scenario.
23."
55,"The High Court
has rightly observed that the Appellant/Accused No. 1 had not
raised the defence of holding the money in escrow for Accused
Nos.",55,"2 and 3 at the time of search conducted at his house on
24.01.2001."
55,"2 and 3 at a
highly belated stage on 4.02.2002, almost a year after the
recovery of the seized currency, though the Appellant had
corresponded with Accused No. 2 in May­June, 2001.",55,"It is
improbable in the ordinary course of conduct that a person
would wait so long to claim an amount of approximately Rs. 80
lakhs which was required for completion of sale transaction."
